The Priority Programme "Software for Exascale Computing" (SPPEXA) of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) addresses 
fundamental research on the various aspects of HPC software, which is 
particularly urgent against the background that we are currently entering the 
era of ubiquitous massive parallelism.

["ExaSolvers"](http://www.sppexa.de/general-information/projects.html#EXASOLVERS) is a project within SPPEXA, concerned with the development of solvers for coupled problems that can be used efficiently in extreme-scale simulations.
The benchmark problem of the project is the numerical simulation of permeation of human skin, an application that is of great interest for example for the development of pharmaceuticals.
Through the lead agency agreement between, SNSF is funding a subproject within ExaSolvers at ICS Lugano [SNSF-145271](http://p3.snf.ch/project-145271), which, in the framework of the project, addresses the development of efficient time-parallel solvers and their application to heterogeneous diffusion problems on complex domains.

At ICS, Andreas Kreienbuehl and Daniel Ruprecht are working on the project as members of the scientific staff.
