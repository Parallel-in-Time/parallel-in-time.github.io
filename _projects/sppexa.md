The Priority Programme "Software for Exascale Computing" (SPPEXA) of the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) addresses fundamental research on the various aspects of HPC software,
which is particularly urgent against the background that we are currently entering the era of
ubiquitous massive parallelism.

["ExaSolvers"](http://www.sppexa.de/general-information/projects.html#EXASOLVERS) is a project
within SPPEXA, concerned with the development of solvers for coupled problems that can be used
efficiently in extreme-scale simulations.
The benchmark problem of the project is the numerical simulation of permeation of human skin, an
application that is of great interest for example for the development of pharmaceuticals {% cite KreienbuehlEtAl2015 RuprechtEtAl2016 %}.
Through the lead agency agreement between, SNSF is funding a subproject within ExaSolvers at ICS
Lugano [SNSF-145271](http://p3.snf.ch/project-145271), which, in the framework of the project,
addresses the development of efficient time-parallel solvers and their application to heterogeneous
diffusion problems on complex domains.
