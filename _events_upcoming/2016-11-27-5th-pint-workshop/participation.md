the workshop, please contact [Matthew Emmett](mailto:memmett@gmail.com).

Accommodation and meals are covered by BIRS (yes, room and board are
*free of charge*!).  As such, **participants are expected to cover

associated with getting from the [Calgary International Aiport

We encourage all invited participants to submit an abstract for review
by the scientific by the [Parallel-in-Time Scientific
Committee][PINTSC].  Unfortunately, due to scheduling constraints, it
may not be possible for all participants to give a talk.

**Abstracts are due by September 23 2016.** Abstracts
can be submitted online through [the abstract submission
form][ABSTRACTS] or by emailing them to [Matthew Emmett](mailto:memmett@gmail.com).

## Proceedings

Participants with accepted abstracts will be invited to publish their
contributions, in the format of a short paper (maximum of 20 pages) in
the proceedings of the workshop, which will be published as a special
issue of **Computing and Visualization in Science** (Springer).

## Funding

Limited travel funding is available for:
1. Students from the EU; please see the [travel grants][JSCGRANTS] page.
