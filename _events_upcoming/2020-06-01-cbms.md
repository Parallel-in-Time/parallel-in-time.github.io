The Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences is pleased to host a
parallel-in-time training workshop, June 1-5, 2020 at 
[Michigan Technological University](https://www.mtu.edu/) in [Houghton, Michigan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Houghton,+MI+49931/@37.0561046,-101.0129579,4.43z).  More details can be found on the [workshop website](http://conferences.math.mtu.edu/cbms2020).


The primary focus of the proposed parallel-in-time workshop is to
educate and inspire researchers and students in new and innovative
numerical techniques for the parallel-in-time solution of large-scale
evolution problems on modern supercomputing architectures, and to
stimulate further studies in their analysis and applications. This
workshop aligns with the National Strategic Computing Initiative
(NSCI) objective: “increase coherence between technology for
modeling/simulation and data analytics”.  The conference will feature
ten lectures by Professor Gander, an expert in parallel time
integration. Using appropriate mathematical methodologies from the
theory of partial differential equations in a functional analytic
setting, numerical discretizations, integration techniques, and
convergence analyses of these iterative methods, conference
participants will be exposed to the numerical analysis of
parallel-in-time methodologies and their implementations. The proposed
topics include multiple shooting type methods, waveform relaxation
methods, time-multigrid methods, and direct time-parallel
methods. These lectures will be accessible to a wide audience from a
broad range of disciplines, including mathematics, computer science
and engineering.
