short_desc: A framework for solving partial differential equations useing modern spectral methods
---

Dedalus is a flexible framework for solving partial differential equations using modern spectral methods. The code is open-source and developed by a team of researchers studying astrophysical, geophysical, and biological fluid dynamics.

Dedalus is written primarily in Python and features an easy-to-use interface with symbolic vectorial equation specification.
