	abstract = {{Peer two-step W-methods are designed for integration of stiff initial value problems with parallelism
		across the method.
		The essential feature is that in each time step $s$ 'peer' approximations are employed having similar properties.
		In fact, no primary solution variable is distinguished.
		Parallel implementation of these stages is easy since information from one previous time step is used only and
		the different linear systems may be solved simultaneously.
		This paper introduces a subclass having order $s-1$ where optimal damping for stiff problems is obtained by using
		different system parameters in different stages.
		Favourable properties of this subclass are uniform stability for realistic stepsize sequences and a
		superconvergence property which is proved using a polynomial collocation formulation.

	abstract={{'Parareal' attempts to speed up the solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by parallelizing
		the time dimension.
		Different solutions are obtained in parallel on different subintervals.
		An iterative procedure is employed to match the solution values at the end of each subinterval with those at the
		beginning of the next one.
		It has been shown that insufficient 'parareal' iterations lead to an inaccurate solution, while too many
		iterations waste CPU cycles without bringing any improvement to the solution.
		In this paper we discuss an error control mechanism for both the classical 'parareal' time discretization method
		and its adaptive variant.
		This mechanism can be effectively used as a mean of controlling the number of 'parareal' iterations.
		We show that bounding the difference between the solution of the fine integrator and the 'parareal' solution by
		the local truncation error of the fine grid leads to a sufficient convergence criterion that guaranties a
		solution that is accurate enough in a minimum number of iterations.
		Tests on a nonlinear problem illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed error control mechanism on the
		classical automatic adaptive time stepping formulation of an embedded method on the two-level 'parareal'
		algorithm.}},

	abstract={{In this paper, we describe block matrix algorithms for the iterative solution of a large-scale linear-quadratic optimal control problem involving a parabolic partial differential equation over a finite control horizon. We consider an ?all at once? discretization of the problem and formulate three iterative algorithms. The first algorithm is based on preconditioning a symmetric positive definite reduced linear system involving only the unknown control variables; however inner-outer iterations are required. The second algorithm modifies the first algorithm to avoid inner-outer iterations by introducing an auxiliary variable. It yields a symmetric indefinite system with a positive definite block preconditioner. The third algorithm is the central focus of this paper. It modifies the preconditioner in the second algorithm by a parallel-in-time preconditioner based on the parareal algorithm. Theoretical results show that the preconditioned algorithms have optimal convergence properties and parallel scalability. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.}},

	abstract = {{The applicability of the Parareal parallel-in-time integration scheme for the solution of a linear,
		two-dimensional hyperbolic acoustic-advection system, which is often used as a test case for integration schemes
		for numerical weather prediction (NWP), is addressed.
		Parallel-in-time schemes are a possible way to increase, on the algorithmic level, the amount of parallelism, a
		requirement arising from the rapidly growing number of CPUs in high performance computer systems.
		A recently introduced modification of the "parallel implicit time-integration algorithm" could successfully
		solve hyperbolic problems arising in structural dynamics.
		It has later been cast into the framework of Parareal.
		The present paper adapts this modified Parareal and employs it for the solution of a hyperbolic flow problem,
		where the initial value problem solved in parallel arises from the spatial discretization of a partial
		differential equation by a finite difference method.
		It is demonstrated that the modified Parareal is stable and can produce reasonably accurate solutions while
		allowing for a noticeable reduction of the time-to-solution.
		The implementation relies on integration schemes already widely used in NWP (RK-3, partially split forward
		Euler, forward-backward).
		It is demonstrated that using an explicit partially split scheme for the coarse integrator allows to avoid the
		use of an implicit scheme while still achieving speedup.}},

	abstract = {{We present a novel space-time parallel version of the Barnes-Hut tree code PEPC using PFASST, the
		Parallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space and Time.
		The naive use of increasingly more processors for a fixed-size N-body problem is prone to saturate as soon as
		the number of unknowns per core becomes too small.
		To overcome this intrinsic strong-scaling limit, we introduce temporal parallelism on top of pepc's existing
		hybrid MPI/PThreads spatial decomposition.
		Here, we use PFASST which is based on a combination of the iterations of the parallel-in-time algorithm parareal
		with the sweeps of spectral deferred correction (SDC) schemes.
		By combining these sweeps with multiple space-time discretization levels, PFASST relaxes the theoretical bound
		on parallel efficiency in parareal.
		We present results from runs on up to 262,144 cores on the IBM Blue Gene/P installation JUGENE, demonstrating
		that the space-time parallel code provides speedup beyond the saturation of the purely space-parallel approach.}},

	abstract={{Time parallel time integration methods have received renewed interest
over the last decade because of the advent of massively parallel computers, which
is mainly due to the clock speed limit reached on today's processors. When solving
time dependent partial differential equations, the time direction is usually not used
for parallelization. But when parallelization in space saturates, the time direction
offers itself as a further direction for parallelization. The time direction is however
special, and for evolution problems there is a causality principle: the solution later
in time is affected (it is even determined) by the solution earlier in time, but not the
other way round. Algorithms trying to use the time direction for parallelization must
therefore be special, and take this very different property of the time dimension into
account.
We show in this chapter how time domain decomposition methods were invented,
and give an overview of the existing techniques. Time parallel methods can be classified
into four different groups: methods based on multiple shooting, methods based
on domain decomposition and waveform relaxation, space-time multigrid methods
and direct time parallel methods. We show for each of these techniques the main
inventions over time by choosing specific publications and explaining the core ideas
of the authors. This chapter is for people who want to quickly gain an overview of
the exciting and rapidly developing area of research of time parallel methods.}},

		As the name suggests, PFASST is similar in spirit to a space-time FAS multigrid method performed over multiple
		time-steps in parallel.
		However, since the original focus of PFASST has been on the performance of the method in terms of time
		parallelism, the solution of any spatial system arising from the use of implicit or semi-implicit temporal

		PFASST iterations and whether this strategy leads to a more efficient overall approach.
		This paper presents an initial investigation on the relative performance of different strategies for coupling
		PFASST iterations with multigrid methods for the implicit treatment of diffusion terms in PDEs.
		In particular, we compare full accuracy multigrid solves at each sub-step with a small fixed number of multigrid
		V-cycles.
		This reduces the cost of each PFASST iteration at the possible expense of a corresponding increase in the number
		of PFASST iterations needed for convergence.
		Parallel efficiency of the resulting methods is explored through numerical examples.}},

	abstract = {{The paper presents first a linear stability analysis for the time-parallel Parareal method, using an
		IMEX Euler as coarse and a Runge-Kutta-3 method as fine propagator, confirming that dominant imaginary
		eigenvalues negatively affect Parareal's convergence.
		This suggests that when Parareal is applied to the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations, problems for small
		viscosities could arise.
		Numerical results for a driven cavity benchmark are presented, confirming that Parareal's convergence can indeed
		deteriorate as viscosity decreases and the flow becomes increasingly dominated by convection.
		The effect is found to strongly depend on the spatial resolution.}},
