The transient stability problem is viewed as a coupled set of nonlinear algebraic and differential equations; by applying a discretization method such as the trapezoidal rule, the overall algebraic-differential set of equations is thus transformed into an unique algebraic problem at each time step. A solution that considers every time step, not in a sequential way but concurrently, is suggested. The solution of this set of equations with a relaxation-type indirect method gives rise to a highly parallel algorithm. The method can handle all the typical dynamic models of realistic power system components. Test results are presented and shown to favorably compare with those obtained with the sequential dishonest Newton algorithm for realistic power systems}},

By applying a stable integration method, the overall algebraic-differential set of equations can be transformed into a unique algebraic problem at each time step.

A class of relaxation/Newton algorithms can be used to solve this problem efficiently. This formulation permits easy implementation of multigrid techniques. The convergence rates and computational complexity of the algorithms are discussed. Test results for realistic power systems confirm theoretical expectations and show the promise of a several-fold increase in speed over that obtainable by traditional parallel-in-space approaches. The synergism obtainable by parallelism in time and in space can provide speed-up adequate for online implementations of transient stability analysis}},

@article{Sommeijer1993,
	abstract = {For the numerical integration of a stiff ordinary differential equation, fully implicit Runge-Kutta methods offer nice properties, like a high classical order and high stage order as well as an excellent stability behaviour. However, such methods need the solution of a set of highly coupled equations for the stage values and this is a considerable computational task. This paper discusses an iteration scheme to tackle this problem. By means of a suitable choice of the iteration parameters, the implicit relations for the stage values, as they occur in each iteration, can be uncoupled so that they can be solved in parallel. The resulting scheme can be cast into the class of Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) methods and, similar to these methods, requires only one LU factorization per step (per processor). The stability as well as the computational efficiency of the process strongly depends on the particular choice of the iteration parameters and on the number of iterations performed. We discuss several choices to obtain good stability and fast convergence. Based on these approaches, we wrote two codes possessing local error control and stepsize variation. We have implemented both codes on an ALLIANT FX/4 machine (four parallel vector processors and shared memory) and measured their speedup factors for a number of test problems. Furthermore, the performance of these codes is compared with the performance of the best stiff ODE codes for sequential computers, like SIMPLE, LSODE and RADAU5.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we analyze parallel, diagonally implicit iteration of Runge-Kutta methods (PDIRK methods) for solving large systems of stiff equations on parallel computers. Like Newton-iterated backward differentiation formulas (BDFs), these PDIRK methods are such that in each step the (sequential) costs consist of solving a number of linear systems with the same matrix of coefficients and with the same dimension as the system of differential equations. Although for PDIRK methods the number of linear systems is usually higher than for Newton iteration of BDFs, the more computationally intensive work of computing the matrix of coefficients and its LU-decomposition are identical. The advantage of PDIRK methods over Newton-iterated BDFs is their unconditional stability (A-stability for Gauss-based methods and L-stability for Radau-based methods) for any order of accuracy. Special characteristics of the PDIRK methods will be studied, such as the rate of convergence, the influence of particular predictors on the resulting stability properties, and the stiff error constants in the global error.},

	abstract = {{The paper presents a new parallel method for the transient stability analysis of power systems. For simplicity, the classical power system model is adopted. The implicit trapezoidal rule is used to discretise the set of differential equations which describes the transient stability problem. As is well known, these discretised nonlinear algebraic equations are almost invariably solved by a Newton procedure. A parallel-in-time relaxed Newton method is proposed to solve the overall set of discretised equations concurrently on all the time steps. The proposed method has been tested on Cray-T3D by the use of PVM system. The test results show that the proposed method presents a good compromise between parallelism-in-time and convergence. Some important aspects for parallel transient stability analysis have been clarified}},

across the method.
The essential feature is that in each time step $s$ 'peer' approximations are employed having similar properties.
In fact, no primary solution variable is distinguished.
Parallel implementation of these stages is easy since information from one previous time step is used only and
the different linear systems may be solved simultaneously.
This paper introduces a subclass having order $s-1$ where optimal damping for stiff problems is obtained by using
different system parameters in different stages.
Favourable properties of this subclass are uniform stability for realistic stepsize sequences and a
superconvergence property which is proved using a polynomial collocation formulation.
Numerical tests on a shared memory computer of a matrix-free implementation with Krylov methods are included.}},

original parareal algorithm and the Richardson extrapolation, for the numerical solution of the

Several nonlinear problems are tested to show the advantage of the new algorithm.
The accuracy of the obtained numerical solution is compared with that of its original version (i.e.,
the parareal algorithm based on the same numerical method).}},

	abstract = {{Time stepping algorithm with spatial parallelisation is commonly used to solve time dependent partial differential equations. Computation in each time step is carried out using all processors available before sequentially advancing to the next time step. In cases where few spatial components are involved and there are relatively many processors available for use, this will result in fine granularity and decreased scalability. Naturally one alternative is to parallelise the temporal domain. Several time parallelisation algorithms have been suggested for the past two decades. One of them is the pipelined iterations across time steps. In this pipelined time stepping method, communication however is extensive between time steps during the pipelining process. This causes a decrease in performance on distributed memory environment which often has high message latency. We present a modified pipelined time stepping algorithm based on delayed pipelining and reduced communication strategies to improve overall execution time on a distributed memory environment using MPI. Our goal is to reduce the inter-time step communications while providing adequate information for the next time step to converge. Numerical result confirms that the improved algorithm is faster than the original pipelined algorithm and sequential time stepping algorithm with spatial parallelisation alone. The improved algorithm is most beneficial for fine granularity time dependent problems with limited spatial parallelisation.}},

	abstract = {{'Parareal' attempts to speed up the solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by
parallelizing the time dimension.
Different solutions are obtained in parallel on different subintervals.
An iterative procedure is employed to match the solution values at the end of each subinterval with
those at the beginning of the next one.
It has been shown that insufficient 'parareal' iterations lead to an inaccurate solution, while too
many iterations waste CPU cycles without bringing any improvement to the solution.
In this paper we discuss an error control mechanism for both the classical 'parareal' time
discretization method and its adaptive variant.
This mechanism can be effectively used as a mean of controlling the number of 'parareal' iterations.
We show that bounding the difference between the solution of the fine integrator and the 'parareal'
solution by the local truncation error of the fine grid leads to a sufficient convergence criterion that
guaranties a solution that is accurate enough in a minimum number of iterations.
Tests on a nonlinear problem illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed error control mechanism on
the classical automatic adaptive time stepping formulation of an embedded method on the two-level
'parareal' algorithm.}},

large-scale linear-quadratic optimal control problem involving a parabolic partial differential
equation over a finite control horizon.
We consider an "all at once" discretization of the problem and formulate three iterative algorithms.
The first algorithm is based on preconditioning a symmetric positive definite reduced linear system
involving only the unknown control variables; however inner-outer iterations are required.
The second algorithm modifies the first algorithm to avoid inner-outer iterations by introducing an
auxiliary variable.
It yields a symmetric indefinite system with a positive definite block preconditioner.
The third algorithm is the central focus of this paper.
It modifies the preconditioner in the second algorithm by a parallel-in-time preconditioner based on
the parareal algorithm.
Theoretical results show that the preconditioned algorithms have optimal convergence properties and
parallel scalability.
Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.}},

The key feature is a initial rough approximation of the solution that is iteratively refined by the parallel solvers. We report a derivation of the Parareal method that uses a convergence acceleration technique to improve the accuracy of the solution. Our approach uses firstly an explicit ODE solver to perform the parallel computations with different time-steps and then, a decomposition of the solution into specific convergent series, based on an extrapolation method, allows to refine the precision of the solution. Our proposed method exploits basic explicit integration methods, such as for example the explicit Euler scheme, in order to preserve the simplicity of the global parallel algorithm. The first part of the paper outlines the proposed method applied to the simple explicit Euler scheme and then the derivation of the classical Parareal algorithm is discussed and illustrated with numerical examples.}},

	abstract = {{The applicability of the Parareal parallel-in-time integration scheme for the solution of a linear,
two-dimensional hyperbolic acoustic-advection system, which is often used as a test case for integration schemes
for numerical weather prediction (NWP), is addressed.
Parallel-in-time schemes are a possible way to increase, on the algorithmic level, the amount of parallelism, a
requirement arising from the rapidly growing number of CPUs in high performance computer systems.
A recently introduced modification of the "parallel implicit time-integration algorithm" could successfully
solve hyperbolic problems arising in structural dynamics.
It has later been cast into the framework of Parareal.
The present paper adapts this modified Parareal and employs it for the solution of a hyperbolic flow problem,
where the initial value problem solved in parallel arises from the spatial discretization of a partial
differential equation by a finite difference method.
It is demonstrated that the modified Parareal is stable and can produce reasonably accurate solutions while
allowing for a noticeable reduction of the time-to-solution.
The implementation relies on integration schemes already widely used in NWP (RK-3, partially split forward
Euler, forward-backward).
It is demonstrated that using an explicit partially split scheme for the coarse integrator allows to avoid the
use of an implicit scheme while still achieving speedup.}},

	abstract = {{We present a novel space-time parallel version of the Barnes-Hut tree code PEPC using PFASST, the
Parallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space and Time.
The naive use of increasingly more processors for a fixed-size N-body problem is prone to saturate as soon as
the number of unknowns per core becomes too small.
To overcome this intrinsic strong-scaling limit, we introduce temporal parallelism on top of pepc's existing
hybrid MPI/PThreads spatial decomposition.
Here, we use PFASST which is based on a combination of the iterations of the parallel-in-time algorithm parareal
with the sweeps of spectral deferred correction (SDC) schemes.
By combining these sweeps with multiple space-time discretization levels, PFASST relaxes the theoretical bound
on parallel efficiency in parareal.
We present results from runs on up to 262,144 cores on the IBM Blue Gene/P installation JUGENE, demonstrating
that the space-time parallel code provides speedup beyond the saturation of the purely space-parallel approach.}},

Parallelization of time stepping provides a new direction of parallelization and allows to employ additional
cores to further speed up simulations after spatial parallelization has saturated.
We report on numerical experiments performed on a Cray XE6, simulating a driven cavity flow with and without

Distributed memory parallelization is used in both space and time, featuring up to 2,048 cores in total.
It is confirmed that the space-time-parallel method can provide speedup beyond the saturation of the spatial

However, for a fixed-size simulation of this type, the efficiency of larger processor counts will saturate when the number of grid points per core becomes too small. To overcome this fundamental strong scaling limit in space-parallel approaches, we present a novel time-parallel version of the lattice Boltzmann method using the parareal algorithm. This method is based on a predictor–corrector scheme combined with mesh refinement to enable the simulation of larger number of time steps. We present results of up to a 32× increase in speed for a model system consisting of a cylinder with conditions for laminar flow. The parallel gain obtainable is predicted with strong accuracy, providing a quantitative understanding of the potential impact of this method.}},

In this paper, the accuracy of solving this system by time-serial spectral deferred corrections (SDC) as well as

PFASST is based on intertwining SDC iterations with differing resolution in a manner similar to the Parareal
algorithm and uses a Full Approximation Scheme (FAS) correction to improve the accuracy of coarser SDC
iterations.
It is demonstrated that SDC and PFASST can generate highly accurate solutions, and the performance in terms of

Parallel scaling tests are reported on the Cray XE6 machine ``Monte Rosa'' on up to $16,384$ cores and on the

The efficacy of the combined spatial- and temporal parallelization is shown by demonstrating that using PFASST

Implications of using spatial coarsening strategies in PFASST's multi-level hierarchy in large-scale parallel

The paper presents an implementation of the time-parallel Parareal method in a C++ domain specific language for

This is done by adding an MPI-based implementation of Parareal, which allows us to parallelize in time across

New method in this study, we present a method to solve a model describing the electrical

CUDA in graphical processing unit (GPU).
Results we applied the method of resolution to different dimensions of the geometry of our model

The GPU results are compared with simulations from a multi-core processor cluster, using

comparable calculation time than that of the presented method using GPU.
A gain of a factor 100 in term of computational time between sequential results and those obtained
using the GPU has been obtained, in the case of 3-D geometry.
Given the structure of the GPU, this factor increases according to the fineness of the geometry used
in the computation.

the advent of massively parallel computers, which is mainly due to the clock speed limit reached on today's
processors.
When solving time dependent partial differential equations, the time direction is usually not used for
parallelization.
But when parallelization in space saturates, the time direction offers itself as a further direction for
parallelization.
The time direction is however special, and for evolution problems there is a causality principle: the solution
later in time is affected (it is even determined) by the solution earlier in time, but not the other way round.
Algorithms trying to use the time direction for parallelization must therefore be special, and take this very
different property of the time dimension into account.
We show in this chapter how time domain decomposition methods were invented, and give an overview of the
existing techniques.
Time parallel methods can be classified into four different groups: methods based on multiple shooting, methods
based on domain decomposition and waveform relaxation, space-time multigrid methods and direct time parallel
methods.
We show for each of these techniques the main inventions over time by choosing specific publications and
explaining the core ideas of the authors.

Recently developed techniques for approximating oscillatory scalar functions by rational functions, and accelerated algorithms for computing functions of discretized differential operators are exploited. Principal advantages of the proposed method include: stability even for large time-steps, the possibility to parallelize in time over many characteristic wavelengths and large speed-ups over existing methods in situations where simulation over long times are required. Numerical examples involving the 2D rotating shallow water equations and the 2D wave equation in an inhomogenous medium are presented, and the method is compared to the 4th order Runge?Kutta (RK4) method and to the use of Chebyshev polynomials.

2012 is an iterative strategy for the temporal parallelization of ODEs and discretized PDEs.
As the name suggests, PFASST is similar in spirit to a space-time FAS multigrid method performed over multiple
time-steps in parallel.
However, since the original focus of PFASST has been on the performance of the method in terms of time
parallelism, the solution of any spatial system arising from the use of implicit or semi-implicit temporal
methods within PFASST have simply been assumed to be solved to some desired accuracy completely at each sub-step
and each iteration by some unspecified procedure.
It hence is natural to investigate how iterative solvers in the spatial dimensions can be interwoven with the
PFASST iterations and whether this strategy leads to a more efficient overall approach.
This paper presents an initial investigation on the relative performance of different strategies for coupling
PFASST iterations with multigrid methods for the implicit treatment of diffusion terms in PDEs.
In particular, we compare full accuracy multigrid solves at each sub-step with a small fixed number of multigrid
V-cycles.
This reduces the cost of each PFASST iteration at the possible expense of a corresponding increase in the number
of PFASST iterations needed for convergence.

especially for complex systems where the distribution of barrier heights is very heterogeneous.
Such systems are difficult to investigate using conventional long-timescale techniques and the fact that they

physical insights gained from short simulations.
We introduce a novel simulation technique, Parallel Trajectory Splicing (ParSplice), that aims at addressing
this problem through the timewise parallelization of long trajectories.
The computational efficiency of ParSplice stems from a speculation strategy whereby predictions of the future
evolution of the system are leveraged to increase the amount of work that can be concurrently performed at any
one time, hence improving the scalability of the method.
ParSplice is also able to accurately account for, and potentially reuse, a substantial fraction of the
computational work invested in the simulation.
We validate the method on a simple Ag surface system and demonstrate substantial increases in efficiency

We then demonstrate the power of ParSplice through the study of topology changes in Ag42Cu13 core-shell

The procedure exploits the Parareal paradigm to efficiently couple the two numerical methods, allowing independent grid size and time-step size. The motivations behind this approach are wide-ranging. In particular, one technique may be more efficient or physically more appropriate or less memory consuming than the other depending on the target of the simulation and/or on the sub-region of the computational domain. Furthermore, the coupling with FEM may circumvent some difficulties inherent to lattice Boltzmann discretization, for some domains with complex boundaries, or for some kind of boundary conditions.

	abstract = {{This work investigates the potential of an in-time parallelization of atmospheric chemical kinetics. Its numerical calculation is one time-consuming step within the numerical prediction of the air quality. The widely used parallelization strategies only allow a limited potential level of parallelism. A higher level of parallelism within the codes will be necessary to enable benefits from future exa-scale computing architectures. In air quality prediction codes, chemical kinetics is typically considered to react in isolated boxes over short splitting intervals. This allows their trivial parallelization in space, which however is limited by the number of grid entities. This work pursues a parallelization beyond this trivial potential and investigates a parallelization across time using the so called ``parareal algorithm''. The latter is an iterative prediction-correction scheme, whose efficiency strongly depends on the choice of the predictor. For that purpose, different options are being investigate and compared: Time-stepping schemes with fixed step size, adaptive time-stepping schemes and repro-models, functional representations, that map a given state to a later state in time. Only the choice of repromodels leads to a speed-up through parallelism, compared to the sequential reference for the scenarios considered here.}},

In particular we study the incompressible, unsteady N-S equations with periodic boundary condition in time. A sequential time integration limits the parallelism of the solver to the spatial variables and can therefore be an obstacle to parallel scalability. Time periodicity allows for a space-time discretization, which adds time as an additional direction for parallelism and thus can improve parallel scalability. To achieve fast convergence, we used a space-time multigrid algorithm with a SCGS smoothing procedure (symmetrical coupled Gauss–Seidel, a.k.a. box smoothing). This technique, proposed by Vanka (J Comput Phys 65:138–156, 1986), for the steady viscous incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is extended to the unsteady case and its properties are studied using local Fourier analysis. We used numerical experiments to analyze the scalability and the convergence of the solver, focusing on the case of a pulsatile flow.}},

	abstract = {{The parareal algorithm is used to obtain temporal parallelization added to the parallelism obtained from the conventional spatial domain decomposition techniques for hydrodynamic problems. Parareal solution becomes unstable at high Reynolds numbers where the non-linear convection term in the Navier-Stokes equations becomes much larger than the diffusion term. A new framework that allows using parareal for unsteady high Reynolds number hydrodynamic problems is proposed where parareal coarse and fine time integration operators are incorporated with coarse and fine spatial grids respectively and \{RANS\} or \{DES\} turbulence models are employed with a blended filter that can be tuned for the stability of the method. This framework is composed of three solution stages where parareal serves as a transitional stage that bridges a coarse grid solution to a fine grid one. While in lower Reynolds number problems parareal solution can serve as a final solution, in higher Reynolds number problems with high degree of non-linearity parareal provides a shorter path to the final solution. Anticipating a parareal stage in a transitional sense allows a looser convergence requirement which leads to high speedup gains in that stage. On the other hand improved initial values at the beginning of the last stage yields a shorter final fine stage solution. A windowing technique is employed in this methodology to further control the parareal instabilities by keeping the parareal corrections smaller while still being able to cover an arbitrary simulation time with given computational resources. Application of this methodology has been illustrated with a fully turbulent vortex shedding from a cylinder and a flow from the Grand Passage tidal zone in the Bay of Fundy. It is concluded that a tuned turbulence model may sufficiently stabilize the parareal methodology for many practical problems such that it becomes applicable in the initialization process if not accurate enough as a final solution. \{MPI\} and OpenMP programming paradigms are used for temporal parallelism introduced by parareal and data parallelism obtained via spatial domain decomposition methods respectively. Also all computational tasks are accelerated using \{CUDA\} compatible GPGPUs.}},

These methods have the potential to achieve dramatically better performance compared to time-stepping approaches, but achieving this performance requires carefully choosing the amount of parallelism devoted to space versus the amount devoted to time. Here, we present
a performance model that, for a multigrid-in-time solver, makes the decision on when to switch to parallel-in-time and on how much parallelism to devote to space vs. time.

This paper investigates application of Parareal in time algorithm for fast dynamic simulations. Parareal algorithm belongs to the class of temporal decomposition methods which divide the time interval into sub-intervals and solve them concurrently. Time-parallel algorithms face the difficulty of providing correct initial conditions for all the sub-intervals which impact the convergence rates. Parareal overcomes this difficulty by using an approximate trajectory. It has become popular in recent years for long transient simulations (e.g., molecular dynamics, fusion, reacting flows). This paper presents an approach for reliable implementation of Parareal with detailed models of power systems including saturation. Windowing approach is proposed for improving the convergence. Parareal is compared with the Newton-based time-parallel method. Effectiveness of the algorithm is analyzed by parallel emulation using extensive case studies on 10-generator 39-bus system and 327-generator 2383-bus system for various disturbances. Parareal with simulation windows of 1 s have shown convergence in 1 to 3 iterations for majority of the simulated cases, irrespective of the size of the system and nature of the disturbance.

The idea is to explicitly construct an approximation to the time-evolution operator $\exp (\tau \mathcal {L})$ for a relatively large time-step $\tau $. Recently developed techniques for approximating oscillatory scalar functions by rational functions, and accelerated algorithms for computing functions of discretized differential operators are exploited. Principal advantages of the proposed method include: stability even for large time-steps, the possibility to parallelize in time over many characteristic wavelengths and large speed-ups over existing methods in situations where simulation over long times are required. Numerical examples involving the 2D rotating shallow water equations and the 2D wave equation in an inhomogenous medium are presented, and the method is compared to the 4th order Runge–Kutta (RK4) method and to the use of Chebyshev polynomials.

Due to the comparatively low parallel efficiency of parallel-in-time integration techniques, they are primar- ily of interest as an extension for classical approaches at parallelism. As such, potential applications are expected to scale across several hundreds, or possibly thousands of nodes, making algorithmic resilience towards hardware in- duced errors highly relevant.

For symmetric positive definite (SPD) system u ′ ( t ) + A u ( t ) = g ( t ) arising from semi-discretizing time-dependent PDEs, if we fix the G -propagator to the Backward-Euler method and choose for F some L -stable time-integrator it can be proven that the convergence factors of the corresponding parareal algorithms satisfy ρ ≈ 1 3 , ∀ J ≥ 2 and ∀ σ ( A ) ⊂ [ 0 , + ∞ ) , where σ ( A ) is the spectrum of the matrix A . However, this result does not hold when time-integrators that lack L -stability, such as the Trapezoidal rule and the 4th-order Gauss \{RK\} method, are chosen as the F -propagator. The parareal algorithms using these two methods for the F -propagator are denoted by Parareal-TR and Parareal-Gauss4. In this paper, we propose a strategy to let these two parareal algorithms possess such a uniform convergence property. The idea is to choose an L -stable propagator F ˜ and on each coarse time-interval [ T n , T n + 1 ] we perform first two steps of F ˜ , then followed by J − 2 steps of F . Precisely, for the Trapezoidal rule we select the 2nd-order \{SDIRK\} method as the F ˜ -propagator, and for the 4th-order Gauss \{RK\} method we select the 4th-order Lobatto III-C method as the F ˜ -propagator.

	abstract = {{In this work, we propose two-level space-time domain decomposition preconditioners for parabolic problems discretized using finite elements. They are motivated as an extension to space-time of balancing domain decomposition by constraints preconditioners. The key ingredients to be defined are the subassembled space and operator, the coarse degrees of freedom (DOFs) in which we want to enforce continuity among subdomains at the preconditioner level, and the transfer operator from the subassembled to the original finite element space. With regard to the subassembled operator, a perturbation of the time derivative is needed to end up with a well-posed preconditioner. The set of coarse DOFs includes the time average (at the space-time subdomain) of classical space constraints plus new constraints between consecutive subdomains in time. Numerical experiments show that the proposed schemes are weakly scalable in time, i.e., we can efficiently exploit increasing computational resources to solve more time steps in the same total elapsed time. Further, the scheme is also weakly space-time scalable, since it leads to asymptotically constant iterations when solving larger problems both in space and time. Excellent wall clock time weak scalability is achieved for space-time parallel solvers on some thousands of cores.}},

The algorithm can be used to model grounded source IP surveys that show EM induction effects as well as airborne time-domain electromagnetic surveys that exhibit IP effects. IP effects are most often approximated as static or modelled in the frequency domain, using frequency dependent electrical conductivity. It is difficult to translate the frequency dependent conductivity approach directly to the time domain in a computationally efficient manner. We take an alternative approach in which we model IP relaxations in time using the stretched exponential function. We incorporate this IP model into a direct time-stepping discretization of the quasi-static time-domain Maxwell equations. We show that modelling of IP effects with this stretched exponential approach is asymptotically equivalent to the commonly used Cole-Cole model of IP transformed to the time-domain. We have implemented our algorithm using efficient numerical methods that allow it to tackle large scale problems and are amenable to use in inversion. In particular we have developed a parallel time-stepping technique that allows us to compute transient electric fields at multiple time-steps simultaneously. We demonstrate the behaviour of the stretched exponential model of IP decay as well as the efficiency of our algorithm by applying it to synthetic numerical examples that simulate a grounded source IP survey with significant EM effects and a concentric-loop airborne EM sounding over a chargeable body.}},

MGRIT is a scalable and multilevel approach to parallel-in-time simulations that nonintrusively uses existing time-stepping schemes, and in a specific two-level setting it is equivalent to the widely known parareal algorithm. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we present a two-level MGRIT convergence analysis for linear problems where the spatial discretization matrix can be diagonalized, and then apply this analysis to our two basic model problems, the heat equation and the advection equation. One important assumption is that the coarse and fine time-grid propagators can be diagaonalized by the same set of eigenvectors, which is often the case when the same spatial discretization operator is used on the coarse and fine time grids. In many cases, the MGRIT algorithm is guaranteed to converge, and we demonstrate numerically that the theoretically predicted convergence rates are sharp in practice for our model problems. Second, we explore how the convergence of MGRIT compares to the stability of the chosen time-stepping scheme. In particular, we demonstrate that a stable time-stepping scheme does not necessarily imply convergence of MGRIT, although MGRIT with FCF-relaxation always converges for the diffusion dominated problems considered here.}},

	abstract = {{The need for parallelism in the time dimension is being driven by changes in computer architectures, where performance increases are now provided through greater concurrency, not faster clock speeds. This creates a bottleneck for sequential time marching schemes because they lack parallelism in the time dimension. Multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) is an iterative procedure that allows for temporal parallelism by utilizing multigrid reduction techniques and a multilevel hierarchy of coarse time grids. MGRIT has been shown to be effective for linear problems, with speedups of up to 50 times. The goal of this work is the efficient solution of nonlinear problems with MGRIT, where efficiency is defined as achieving similar performance when compared to an equivalent linear problem. The benchmark nonlinear problem is the $p$-Laplacian, where p=4 corresponds to a well-known nonlinear diffusion equation and $p=2$ corresponds to the standard linear diffusion operator, our benchmark linear problem. The key difficulty encountered is that the nonlinear time-step solver becomes progressively more expensive on coarser time levels as the time-step size increases. To overcome such difficulties, multigrid research has historically targeted an accumulated body of experience regarding how to choose an appropriate solver for a specific problem type. To that end, this paper develops a library of MGRIT optimizations and modifications, most important an alternate initial guess for the nonlinear time-step solver and delayed spatial coarsening, that will allow many nonlinear parabolic problems to be solved with parallel scaling behavior comparable to the corresponding linear problem.}},

In contrast, traditional time-integration techniques impose serious limitations on parallel performance due to the sequential nature of the time-stepping approach, allowing spatial concurrency only. This paper considers the three basic options of multigrid algorithms on space--time grids that allow parallelism in space and time: coarsening in space and time, semicoarsening in the spatial dimensions, and semicoarsening in the temporal dimension. We develop parallel software and performance models to study the three methods at scales of up to 16K cores and introduce an extension of one of them for handling multistep time integration.

The efficiency of the method depends on fast approximations of this matrix exponential based on recent results from numerical linear algebra.

	abstract = {{Abstract In this paper, we develop new techniques for solving the large, coupled linear systems that arise from fully implicit Runge–Kutta methods. This method makes use of the iterative preconditioned \{GMRES\} algorithm for solving the linear systems, which has seen success for fluid flow problems and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. By transforming the resulting linear system of equations, one can obtain a method which is much less computationally expensive than the untransformed formulation, and which compares competitively with other time-integration schemes, such as diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta (DIRK) methods. We develop and test several ILU-based preconditioners effective for these large systems. We additionally employ a parallel-in-time strategy to compute the Runge–Kutta stages simultaneously. Numerical experiments are performed on the Navier–Stokes equations using Euler vortex and 2D and 3D \{NACA\} airfoil test cases in serial and in parallel settings. The fully implicit Radau \{IIA\} Runge–Kutta methods compare favorably with equal-order \{DIRK\} methods in terms of accuracy, number of \{GMRES\} iterations, number of matrix–vector multiplications, and wall-clock time, for a wide range of time steps.}},

By providing fully resolved trajectories, it allows for a natural description of static, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties. A major hurdle that has hampered the use of MD is the fact that the timescales that can be directly simulated are very limited, even when using massively parallel computers. In this study, we compare two time-parallelization approaches, parallel replica dynamics (ParRep) and parallel trajectory splicing (ParSplice), that were specifically designed to address this issue for rare event systems by leveraging parallel computing resources. Using simulations of the relaxation of small disordered platinum nanoparticles, a comparative performance analysis of the two methods is presented. The results show that ParSplice can significantly outperform ParRep in the common case where the trajectory remains trapped for a long time within a region of configuration space but makes rapid structural transitions within this region.}},

Currently time-dependent EM solvers are typically parallel only in space. The sequential-in-time nature of these solvers can achieve good parallel scaling when the number of spatial mesh points per core is large. But the parallel efficiency quickly deteriorates and even saturates if spatial parallelism has been fully exploited. We proposed a new time domain EM solver to harvest parallelism in both spatial and temporal dimension. The spatial parallelism is achieved by discontinuous Galerkin formulation, and the temporal parallelism is enabled by Krylov subspace method based exponential integrator. This work results in a highly scalable parallel time domain solver which can amend the scalability issue for traditional ones.

Second, we state the global nonlinear problem in terms of the nonlinear Schur complement (at an arbitrary level), and perform nonlinear iterations over it.

Inspired by the classical Parareal method and multigrid ideas, PFASST allows to integrate multiple time steps simultaneously using a space–time hierarchy of spectral deferred correction sweeps. While many use cases and benchmarks exist, a solid and reliable mathematical foundation is still missing. Very recently, however, PFASST for linear problems has been identified as a multigrid method. In this paper, we will use this multigrid formulation and, in particular, PFASST's iteration matrix to show that, in the nonstiff and stiff limit, PFASST indeed is a convergent iterative method. We will provide upper bounds for the spectral radius of the iteration matrix and investigate how PFASST performs for increasing numbers of parallel time steps.

The basic concept is to solve for large blocks of space-time unknowns instead of marching sequentially in time. The methodology is a combination of a computationally efficient implementation of a parallel-in-space-time finite element solver coupled with a posteriori space-time error estimates and a parallel mesh generator. While we focus on spatial adaptivity in this work, the methodology enables simultaneous adaptivity in both space and time domains. We explore this basic concept in the context of a variety of time steppers including $\Theta$-schemes and backward difference formulas. We specifically illustrate this framework with applications involving time dependent linear, quasi-linear, and semilinear diffusion equations. We focus on investigating how the coupled space-time refinement indicators for this class of problems affect spatial adaptivity. Finally, we show good scaling behavior up to 150,000 processors on the NCSA Blue Waters machine. This conceptually simple methodology enables scaling on next generation multicore machines by simultaneously solving for a large number of timesteps, and reducing computational overhead by locally refining spatial blocks that can track localized features. This methodology also opens up the possibility of efficiently incorporating adjoint equations for error estimators and inverse design problems, since blocks of space-time are simultaneously solved and stored in memory.}},

	abstract = {{In this paper, an adjoint solver for the multigrid in time software library XBraid is presented. XBraid provides a non-intrusive approach for simulating unsteady dynamics on multiple processors while parallelizing not only in space but also in the time domain. It applies an iterative multigrid reduction in time algorithm to existing spatially parallel classical time propagators and computes the unsteady solution parallel in time. Techniques from Automatic Differentiation are used to develop a consistent discrete adjoint solver which provides sensitivity information of output quantities with respect to design parameter changes. The adjoint code runs backwards through the primal XBraid actions and accumulates gradient information parallel in time. It is highly non-intrusive as existing adjoint time propagators can easily be integrated through the adjoint interface. The adjoint code is validated on advection-dominated flow with periodic upstream boundary condition. It provides similar strong scaling results as the primal XBraid solver and offers great potential for speeding up the overall computational costs for sensitivity analysis using multiple processors}},

	abstract = {{This paper presents some recent advances for parallel‐in‐time methods applied to linear elasticity. With recent computer architecture changes leading to stagnant clock speeds, but ever increasing numbers of cores, future speedups will be available through increased concurrency. Thus, sequential algorithms, such as time stepping, will suffer a bottleneck. This paper explores multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) for an important application area, linear elasticity. Previously, efforts at parallel‐in‐time for elasticity have experienced difficulties, for example, the beating phenomenon. As a result, practical parallel‐in‐time algorithms for this application area currently do not exist. This paper proposes some solutions made possible by MGRIT (e.g., slow temporal coarsening and FCF‐relaxation) and, more importantly, a different formulation of the problem that is more amenable to parallel‐in‐time methods. Using a recently developed convergence theory for MGRIT and Parareal, we show that the changed formulation of the problem avoids the instability issues and allows the reduction of the error using two temporal grids. We then extend our approach to the multilevel case, where we demonstrate how slow temporal coarsening improves convergence. The paper ends with supporting numerical results showing a practical algorithm enjoying speedup benefits over the sequential algorithm.}},

However, the need for derivatives imposes a difficult requirement when integrating ordinary differential equations in models. To simplify this, we propose the use of the general linear methods framework, which unifies all Runge–Kutta and linear multistep methods. This approach enables rapid implementation of integration methods without the need to differentiate each individual method, even in a gradient-based optimization context. We also develop a new parallel time integration algorithm that enables vectorization across time steps. We present a set of benchmarking results using a stiff ODE, a non-stiff nonlinear ODE, and an orbital dynamics ODE, and compare integration methods. In a modular gradient-based multidisciplinary design optimization context, we find that the new parallel time integration algorithm with high-order implicit methods, especially Gauss–Legendre collocation, is the best choice for a broad range of problems.}},

	abstract = {{Gander and Petcu (ESAIM Proc 25:114–129, 2008) reported that, theoretically, the convergence of the parareal method iteration for hyperbolic PDEs is strongly influenced by the phase (frequency) accuracy of the coarse solver calculation. However, no numerical study has clearly shown this. Therefore, through numerical tests, we investigate the influence of the phase accuracy of the coarse solver calculation on the convergence of the parareal method iteration for hyperbolic PDEs. First, we consider a simple harmonic motion and a multi-DOF mass-spring system (MDMSS) as examples of hyperbolic PDEs using the modified Newmark-  β method (Mizuta et al. in J JSCE 268:15–21, 1977), which can provide the exact phase of the time integration of a simple harmonic motion. Based on the results of the numerical tests, we show that the convergence of the parareal method iteration for hyperbolic PDEs is approximately independent of the parameters of parallel-in-time integration (PinT) and instead is dependent primarily on the phase accuracy of the coarse solver calculation. In addition, we show that reducing the number of bases in the reduced basis method (RBM) (Chen et al., in: Rozza (ed) Reduced order methods for modeling and computational reduction, MS and a modeling, simulation and applications, vol 9, Springer, Berlin, pp 187–214, 2014) causes the saturation of a decrease in an error during the parareal iteration for the MDMSS using the mode analysis method. The RBM is expected to make available accurate phase calculation in the coarse solver by maintaining the time step width as same as that of the fine solver. Second, we investigate whether the same saturation appears for the linear advection–diffusion equation when we use the RBM. We use the time evolution basis method in the RBM for the linear advection–diffusion equation. As a result, we show that reducing the number of bases causes the saturation of the decrease in the error in the linear advection–diffusion equation. Based on the results of the present study, an increase in the phase accuracy of the coarse solver calculation is strongly required for better convergence of the parareal method iteration for hyperbolic PDEs. Moreover, the saturation of the decrease in the error during the parareal method iteration should be overcome when using the RBM.}},

This is achieved by first reformulating the algorithm in a rigorous infinite dimensional functional space setting. We then formulate implementable versions where time dependent subproblems are solved at increasing accuracy across the parareal iterations (in opposition to the classical version where the subproblems are solved at a fixed high accuracy). Aside from the important improvement in parallel efficiency and as a natural by product, the new approach provides a rigourous online stopping criterion with a posteriori error estimators and the numerical cost to achieve a certain final accuracy is designed to be near-minimal.

@article{NielsenEtAl2018,
	abstract = {{In the strong scaling limit, the performance of conventional spatial domain decomposition techniques for the parallel solution of PDEs saturates. When sub-domains become small, halo-communication and other overhead come to dominate. A potential path beyond this scaling limit is to introduce domain-decomposition in time, with one such popular approach being the Parareal algorithm which has received a lot of attention due to its generality and potential scalability. Low efficiency, particularly on convection dominated problems, has however limited the adoption of the method. In this paper we demonstrate trough large-scale numerical experiments that it is possible not only to obtain time-parallel speedup on the non-linear shallow water wave equation, but also that we may obtain parallel acceleration beyond what is possible using conventional spatial domain-decomposition techniques alone. Two factors were essential in achieving this. First, for Parareal to converge on the hyperbolic problem we used an approximate Riemann solver as the preconditioner. This preconditioner introduces only dissipative errors with respect to the 3rd order accurate WENO-RK discretization used to solve the PDE system. The preconditoner is comparatively expensive and convergence is slow unless time-subdomains are short. We therefore introduce a new scheduler that we denote Communication Aware Adaptive Parareal (CAAP). CAAP increases obtainable speed-up by minimizing the time-subdomain length without making communication of time-subdomains too costly whilst also adaptively overlapping consecutive cycles of Parareal so to mitigate the impact of a relatively expensive coarse operator.}},

	abstract = {{This paper presents, discusses and analyses a massively parallel-in-time solver for linear oscillatory partial differential equations, which is a key numerical component for evolving weather, ocean, climate and seismic models. The time parallelization in this solver allows us to significantly exceed the computing resources used by parallelization-in-space methods and results in a correspondingly significantly reduced wall-clock time. One of the major difficulties of achieving Exascale performance for weather prediction is that the strong scaling limit – the parallel performance for a fixed problem size with an increasing number of processors – saturates. A main avenue to circumvent this problem is to introduce new numerical techniques that take advantage of time parallelism. In this paper, we use a time-parallel approximation that retains the frequency information of oscillatory problems. This approximation is based on (a) reformulating the original problem into a large set of independent terms and (b) solving each of these terms independently of each other which can now be accomplished on a large number of high-performance computing resources. Our results are conducted on up to 3586 cores for problem sizes with the parallelization-in-space scalability limited already on a single node. We gain significant reductions in the time-to-solution of 118.3× for spectral methods and 1503.0× for finite-difference methods with the parallelization-in-time approach. A developed and calibrated performance model gives the scalability limitations a priori for this new approach and allows us to extrapolate the performance of the method towards large-scale systems.

	abstract = {{With the stagnation of processor core performance, further reductions in the time to solution for geophysical fluid problems are becoming increasingly difficult with standard time integrators. Parallel‐in‐time exposes and exploits additional parallelism in the time dimension, which is inherently sequential in traditional methods. The rational approximation of exponential integrators (REXI) method allows taking arbitrarily long time steps based on a sum over a number of decoupled complex PDEs that can be solved independently massively parallel. Hence, REXI is assumed to be well suited for modern massively parallel super computers, which are currently trending. To date, the study and development of the REXI approach have been limited to linearized problems on the periodic two‐dimensional plane. This work extends the REXI time stepping method to the linear shallow‐water equations on the rotating sphere, thus moving the method one step closer to solving fully nonlinear fluid problems of geophysical interest on the sphere. The rotating sphere poses particular challenges for finding an efficient solver due to the zonal dependence of the Coriolis term. Here, we present an efficient REXI solver based on spherical harmonics, showing the results of a geostrophic balance test, a comparison with alternative time stepping methods, an analysis of dispersion relations indicating superior properties of REXI, and finally, a performance comparison on the Cheyenne supercomputer. Our results indicate that REXI not only can take larger time steps but also can be used to gain higher accuracy and significantly reduced time to solution compared with currently existing time stepping methods.}},

Using standard low-order time-stepping methods in an iterative fashion, SDC can be seen as preconditioned Picard iteration for the collocation problem. Typically, a serial Gauss-Seidel-like preconditioner is used, computing updates for each collocation node one by one. The goal of this paper is to show how this process can be parallelized, so that all collocation nodes are updated simultaneously. The first strategy aims at finding parallel preconditioners for the Picard iteration and we test three choices using four different test problems. For the second strategy we diagonalize the quadrature matrix of the collocation problem directly. In order to integrate non-linear problems we employ simplified and inexact Newton methods. Here, we estimate the speed of convergence depending on the time-step size and verify our results using a non-linear diffusion problem.}},

The presence of Wiener process in \{SDEs\} causes difficulties in the direct application of any numerical integration techniques of \{ODEs\} including the parareal algorithm. The parallel implementation of the algorithm involves two \{SDEs\} solvers, namely a fine-level scheme to integrate the system in parallel and a coarse-level scheme to generate and correct the required initial conditions to start the fine-level integrators. For the numerical illustration, a randomly excited Duffing oscillator is investigated in order to study the performance of the stochastic parallel algorithm with respect to a range of system parameters.

	abstract = {{In this paper, we present an idea toward parallel coarse grid correction (CGC) for the parareal algorithm. It is well known that such a CGC procedure is often the bottleneck of speedup of the parareal algorithm. For an ODE system with initial-value condition $u(0)=u_0$ the idea can be explained as follows. First, we apply the $\mathcal{G}$-propagator to the same ODE system but with a special condition $u(0)=\alpha u(T)$, where $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ is a crux parameter. Second, in each iteration of the parareal algorithm the CGC procedure will be carried out by the so-called diagonalization technique established recently. The parameter $\alpha$ controls both the roundoff error arising from such a diagonalization technique and the convergence rate of the resulting parareal algorithm. We show that there exists some threshold $\alpha^*$ such that the parareal algorithm with diagonalization-based CGC possesses the same convergence rate as that of the parareal algorithm with classical CGC if $|\alpha|\leq \alpha^*$. With $|\alpha|=\alpha^*$, we show that the condition number associated with the diagonalization technique is a moderate quantity of order $\mathcal{O}(1)$ (and therefore the roundoff error is small) and is independent of the length of the time interval. Numerical results are given to support our findings.}},

The standard SDC method is used in parallel with a rough initial guess and a Picard integral equation with high precision initial condition is acted as a compensator. The goal of this paper is to show how these processes can be parallelized and how to improve the efficiency. During the SDC step an implicit or semi-implicit method can be used for stiff problems which is always time-consuming, therefore that’s why we do this procedure in parallel. Due to a better initial condition of parallel intervals after the SDC step, the goal of compensation step is to get a better approximation and also avoid of solving an implicit problem again. During the compensation step an explicit Picard scheme is taken based on the numerical integration with polynomial interpolation on Gauss Radau II nodes, which is almost no time consumption, obviously, that’s why we do this procedure in serial. The convergency analysis and the parallel efficiency of our method are also discussed. Several numerical experiments and an application for simulation Allen–Cahn equation are presented to show the accuracy, stability, convergence order and efficiency features of para-SDC method.}},

@article{BlumersEtAl2019,
	abstract = {{Lagrangian particle methods based on detailed atomic and molecular models are powerful computational tools for studying the dynamics of microscale and nanoscale systems. However, the maximum time step is limited by the smallest oscillation period of the fastest atomic motion, rendering long-time simulations very expensive. To resolve this bottleneck, we propose a supervised parallel-in-time algorithm for stochastic dynamics (SPASD) to accelerate long-time Lagrangian particle simulations. Our method is inspired by bottom-up coarse-graining projections that yield mean-field hydrodynamic behavior in the continuum limit. Here as an example, we use the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) as the Lagrangian particle simulator that is supervised by its macroscopic counterpart, i.e., the Navier-Stokes simulator. The low-dimensional macroscopic system (here, the Navier-Stokes solver) serves as a predictor to supervise the high-dimensional Lagrangian simulator, in a predictor-corrector type algorithm. The results of the Lagrangian simulation then correct the mean-field prediction and provide the proper microscopic details (e.g., consistent fluctuations, correlations, etc.). The unique feature that sets SPASD apart from other multiscale methods is the use of a low-fidelity macroscopic model as a predictor. The macro-model can be approximate and even inconsistent with the microscale description, but SPASD anticipates the deviation and corrects it internally to recover the true dynamics. We first present the algorithm and analyze its theoretical speedup, and subsequently we present the accuracy and convergence of the algorithm for the time-dependent plane Poiseuille flow, demonstrating that SPASD converges exponentially fast over iterations, irrespective of the accuracy of the predictor. Moreover, the fluctuating characteristics of the stochastic dynamics are identical to the unsupervised (serial in time) DPD simulation. We also compare the performance of SPASD to the conventional spatial decomposition method, which is one of the most parallel-efficient methods for particle simulations. We find that the parallel efficiency of SPASD and the conventional spatial decomposition method are similar for a small number of computing cores, but for a large number of cores the performance of SPASD is superior. Furthermore, SPASD can be used in conjunction with spatial decomposition for enhanced performance. Lastly, we simulate a two-dimensional cavity flow that requires more iterations to converge compared to the Poiseuille flow, and we observe that SPASD converges to the correct solution. Although a DPD solver is used to demonstrate the results, SPASD is a general framework and can be readily applied to other Lagrangian approaches including molecular dynamics and Langevin dynamics.}},

While there are many successful algorithms for diffusive problems, only some of them are also effective for hyperbolic problems. We present here a mathematical analysis of a new method based on the diagonalization of the time stepping matrix proposed by Maday and Rønquist in 2007. Like many time-parallelization methods, at first this does not seem to be a very promising approach: the matrix is essentially triangular, or, for equidistant time steps, actually a Jordan block, and thus not diagonalizable. If one chooses however different time steps, diagonalization is possible, and one has to trade off between the accuracy due to necessarily having different time steps, and numerical errors in the diagonalization process of these almost nondiagonalizable matrices. We present for the first time such a diagonalization technique for the Newmark scheme for solving wave equations, and derive a mathematically rigorous optimization strategy for the choice of the parameters in the special case when the Newmark scheme becomes Crank--Nicolson. Our analysis shows that small to medium scale time parallelization is possible with this approach.

This study is motivated by the observation that sequential time-stepping is a computational bottleneck when attempting to implement highly concurrent algorithms, thus parallel-in-time methods are desirable. MGRIT adds parallelism by using a hierarchy of successively coarser temporal levels to accelerate the solution on the finest level. In the case of explicit time-stepping, spatial coarsening is a suitable approach to ensure that stability conditions are satisfied on all levels, and it may be useful for implicit time-stepping by producing cheaper multigrid cycles. Unfortunately, uniform spatial coarsening results in extremely slow convergence when the wave speed is near zero, even if only locally. We present an adaptive spatial coarsening strategy that addresses this issue for the variable coefficient linear advection equation and the inviscid Burgers equation using first-order explicit or implicit time-stepping methods. Serial numerical results show this method offers significant improvements over uniform coarsening and is convergent for the inviscid Burgers equation with and without shocks. Parallel scaling tests on up to 128K cores indicate that run-time improvements over serial time-stepping strategies are possible when spatial parallelism alone saturates, and that scalability is robust for oscillatory solutions which change on the scale of the grid spacing.}},

Using Fourier analysis, we derive new convergence estimates for these algorithms which, in conjunction with existing convergence theory, provide insight into the origins of this poor performance.

	abstract = {{Schwarz waveform relaxation (SWR) methods have been developed to solve a wide range of diffusion-dominated and reaction-dominated equations. The appeal of these methods stems primarily from their ability to use nonconforming space-time discretizations; SWR methods are consequently well-adapted for coupling models with highly varying spatial and time scales. The efficacy of SWR methods is questionable, however, since in each iteration, one propagates an error across the entire time interval. In this manuscript, we introduce an adaptive pipeline approach wherein one subdivides the computational domain into space-time blocks, and adaptively selects the waveform iterates which should be updated given a fixed number of computational workers. Our method is complementary to existing space and time parallel methods, and can be used to obtain additional speedup when the saturation point is reached for other types of parallelism. We analyze these waveform relaxation with adaptive pipelining (WRAP) methods to show convergence and the theoretical speedup that can be expected. Numerical experiments on solutions to the linear heat equation, the advection-diffusion equation, and a reaction-diffusion equation illustrate features and efficacy of WRAP methods for various transmission conditions.}},

We then propose and analyse an efficient and readily implementable parallel-in-time preconditioner to be used with an inexact Uzawa method. The proposed preconditioner is non-intrusive and easy to implement in practice, and also features the key theoretical advantages of robust spectral bounds, leading to convergence rates that are independent of the number of time-steps, final time, or spatial mesh sizes, and also a theoretical parallel complexity that grows only logarithmically with respect to the number of time-steps.

	abstract = {{High-performance computing trends towards many-core systems are expected to continue over the next decade. As a result, parallel-in-time methods, mathematical formulations which exploit additional degrees of parallelism in the time dimension, have gained increasing interest in recent years. In this work we study a massively parallel rational approximation of exponential integrators (REXI). This method replaces a time integration of stiff linear oscillatory and diffusive systems by the sum of the solutions of many decoupled systems, which can be solved in parallel. Previous numerical studies showed that this reformulation allows taking arbitrarily long time steps for the linear oscillatory parts. The present work studies the non-linear shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere, a simplified system of equations used to study properties of space and time discretization methods in the context of atmospheric simulations. After introducing time integrators, we first compare the time step sizes to the errors in the simulation, discussing pros and cons of different formulations of REXI. Here, REXI already shows superior properties compared to explicit and implicit time stepping methods. Additionally, we present wallclock-time-to-error results revealing the sweet spots of REXI obtaining either an over 6 ×  higher accuracy within the same time frame or an about 3 ×  reduced time-to-solution for a similar error threshold. Our results motivate further explorations of REXI for operational weather/climate systems.}},

@article{Southworth2019,
	abstract = {{Parareal and multigrid reduction in time (MGRiT) are two of the most popular parallel-in-time methods. The basic idea is to treat time integration in a parallel context by using a multigrid method in time. If $\Phi$ is the (fine-grid) time-stepping scheme of interest, such as any Runge--Kutta scheme, then let $\Psi$ denote a “coarse-grid" time-stepping scheme chosen to approximate $k$ steps of $\Phi$, where $k\geq 1$. In particular, $\Psi$ defines the coarse-grid correction, and evaluating $\Psi$ should be (significantly) cheaper than evaluating $\Phi^k$. Parareal is a two-level method with a fixed relaxation scheme, and MGRiT is a generalization to the multilevel setting, with the additional option of a modified, stronger relaxation scheme. A number of papers have studied the convergence of Parareal and MGRiT. However, general conditions on the convergence of Parareal or MGRiT that answer the following simple questions have yet to be developed: (i) For a given $\Phi$ and $k$, what is the best $\Psi$? (ii) Can Parareal/MGRiT converge for my problem? This work derives necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of Parareal and MGRiT applied to linear problems, along with tight two-level convergence bounds, under minimal additional assumptions on $\Phi$ and $\Psi$. Results all rest on the introduction of a temporal approximation property (TAP) that indicates how $\Phi^k$ must approximate the action of $\Psi$ on different vectors. Loosely, for unitarily diagonalizable operators, the TAP indicates that the fine-grid and coarse-grid time integration schemes must integrate geometrically smooth spatial components similarly, and less so for geometrically high frequency. In the (nonunitarily) diagonalizable setting, the conditioning of each eigenvector, ${v}_i$, must also be reflected in how well $\Psi{v}_i \sim\Phi^k{v}_i$. In general, worst-case convergence bounds are exactly given by $\min \varphi < 1$ such that an inequality along the lines of $\|(\Psi-\Phi^k){v}\| \leq\varphi \|(I - \Psi){v}\|$ holds for all ${v}$. Such inequalities are formalized as different realizations of the TAP in section 2 and form the basis for convergence of MGRiT and Parareal applied to linear problems.}},

One example of such a time-parallel code is pySDC, which implements, among others, the parallel full approximation scheme in space and time (PFASST). Inspired by nonlinear multigrid ideas, PFASST allows to integrate multiple time-steps simultaneously using a space-time hierarchy of spectral deferred corrections.

We aim to answer whether the code works as intended and whether the time-parallelization is as efficient as expected. Tracing the path we took for this work, we highlight the obstacles encountered, describe remedies and explain the sometimes surprising findings made possible by the tools.

This process is slow and a major computational bottleneck for robotics planning algorithms. Parallel-in-time integration methods can help to leverage parallel computing to accelerate physics predictions and thus planning. The Parareal algorithm iterates between a coarse serial integrator and a fine parallel integrator. A key challenge is to devise a coarse level model that is computationally cheap but accurate enough for Parareal to converge quickly. Here, we investigate the use of a deep neural network physics model as a coarse model for Parareal in the context of robotic manipulation. In simulated experiments using the physics engine Mujoco as fine propagator we show that the learned coarse model leads to faster Parareal convergence than a coarse physics-based model. We further show that the learned coarse model allows to apply Parareal to scenarios with multiple objects, where the physics-based coarse model is not applicable. Finally, We conduct experiments on a real robot and show that Parareal predictions are close to real-world physics predictions for robotic pushing of multiple objects.

Numerical simulations of natural dynamos are extremely computationally intensive, and are carried out in parameter regimes many orders of magnitude away from real conditions. Parallelization in space is a common strategy to speed up simulations on high performance computers, but eventually hits a scaling limit. Additional directions of parallelization are desirable to utilise the high number of processor cores now available. Parallel-in-time methods can deliver speed up in addition to that offered by spatial partitioning but have not yet been applied to dynamo simulations. This paper investigates the feasibility of using the parallel-in-time algorithm Parareal to speed up initial value problem simulations of the kinematic dynamo, using the open source Dedalus spectral solver. Both the time independent Roberts and time dependent Galloway-Proctor 2.5D dynamos are investigated over a range of magnetic Reynolds numbers. Speedups beyond those possible from spatial parallelisation are found in both cases. Results for the Galloway-Proctor flow are promising, with Parareal efficiency found to be close to 0.3. Roberts flow results are less efficient, but Parareal still shows some speed up over spatial parallelisation alone.

We also investigate the problem of convergence of Parareal with respect to to statistical numerical quantities, such as the Nusselt number, and discuss the importance of reliable online stopping criteria in these cases.},

@unpublished{FlamantEtAl2020,
	abstract = {The time evolution of dynamical systems is frequently described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which must be solved for given initial conditions. Most standard approaches numerically integrate ODEs producing a single solution whose values are computed at discrete times. When many varied solutions with different initial conditions to the ODE are required, the computational cost can become significant. We propose that a neural network be used as a solution bundle, a collection of solutions to an ODE for various initial states and system parameters. The neural network solution bundle is trained with an unsupervised loss that does not require any prior knowledge of the sought solutions, and the resulting object is differentiable in initial conditions and system parameters. The solution bundle exhibits fast, parallelizable evaluation of the system state, facilitating the use of Bayesian inference for parameter estimation in real dynamical systems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the Python framework PyMGRIT, which implements the multigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT) algorithm for solving the (non-)linear systems arising from the discretization of time-dependent problems. The MGRIT algorithm is a reduction-based iterative method that allows parallel-in-time simulations, i. e., calculating multiple time steps simultaneously in a simulation, by using a time-grid hierarchy. The PyMGRIT framework features many different variants of the MGRIT algorithm, ranging from different multigrid cycle types and relaxation schemes, as well as various coarsening strategies, including time-only and space-time coarsening, to using different time integrators on different levels in the multigrid hierachy. PyMGRIT allows serial runs for prototyping and testing of new approaches, as well as parallel runs using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). Here, we describe the implementation of the MGRIT algorithm in PyMGRIT and present the usage from both user and developer point of views. Three examples illustrate different aspects of the package, including pure time parallelism as well as space-time parallelism by coupling PyMGRIT with PETSc or Firedrake, which enable spatial parallelism through MPI.},

In particular, we use the reduced basis method to seek a low-dimensional approximation to the sequence of complex-shifted systems arising from Step-(b) of the ParaDIAG preconditioning procedure. Different from the standard reduced order modeling that uses the separation of offline and online stages, we have to build the reduced order model (ROM) online for the considered systems at each iteration. Therefore, several heuristic acceleration techniques are introduced in the greedy basis generation algorithm, that is built upon a residual-based error indicator, to further boost up its computational efficiency. Several numerical experiments are conducted, which illustrate the favorable computational efficiency of our proposed ROM-accelerated ParaDIAG preconditioner, in comparison with the state of the art multigrid-based ParaDIAG preconditioner.},

In particular, we apply the $k$-step backward differentiation formula, and then develop an iterative solver by using the waveform relaxation technique. Each resulting iterate represents a periodic-like system, which could be further solved in parallel by using the diagonalization technique. The convergence of the waveform relaxation iteration is theoretically examined by using the generating function method. The approach we established in this paper extends the existing argument of single-step methods in Gander and Wu [Numer. Math., 143 (2019), pp. 489--527] to general BDF methods up to order 6. The argument could be further applied to the time-fractional subdiffusion equation, whose discretization shares common properties of the standard BDF methods, because of the nonlocality of the fractional differential operator. Illustrative numerical results are presented to complement the theoretical analysis.},

	abstract = {Volterra subdiffusion problems with weakly singular kernel describe the dynamics of subdiffusion processes well.The graded $L1$ scheme is often chosen to discretize such problems since it can handle the singularity of the solution near $t = 0$. In this paper, we propose a modification. We first split the time interval $[0, T]$ into $[0, T_0]$ and $[T_0, T]$, where $T_0$ ($0 < T_0 < T$) is reasonably small. Then, the graded $L1$ scheme is applied in $[0, T_0]$, while the uniform one is used in $[T_0, T]$. Our all-at-once system is derived based on this strategy. In order to solve the arising system efficiently, we split it into two subproblems and design two preconditioners. Some properties of these two preconditioners are also investigated. Moreover, we extend our method to solve semilinear subdiffusion problems. Numerical results are reported to show the efficiency of our method.},

	abstract = {We study the impact of spatial coarsening on the convergence of the Parareal algorithm, both theoretically and numerically. For initial value problems with a normal system matrix, we prove a lower bound for the Euclidean norm of the iteration matrix. When there is no physical or numerical diffusion, an immediate consequence is that the norm of the iteration matrix cannot be smaller than unoty as soon as the coarse problem has fewer degrees-of-freedom than the fine. This prevents a theoretical guarantee for monotonic convergence, which is necessary to obtain meaningful speedups. For diffusive problems, in the worst-case where the iteration error contracts only as fast as the powers of the iteration matrix norm, making Parareal as accurate as the fine method will take about as many iterations as there are processors, making meaningful speedup impossible. Numerical examples with a non-normal system matrix show that for diffusive problems good speedup is possible, but that for non-diffusive problems the negative impact of spatial coarsening on convergence is big.},

@phdthesis{CaldasEtAl2021,
	abstract = {This PhD thesis aims to study the coupling of nonlinear shallow water models at different scales, with application to the numerical simulation of urban floods. Accurate simulations in this domain are usually prohibitively expensive due to the small mesh sizes necessary for the spatial discretization of the urban geometry and the associated small time steps constrained by stability conditions. Porosity-based shallow water models have been proposed in the past two decades as an alternative approach, consisting of upscaled models using larger mesh sizes and time steps and being able to provide good global approximations for the solution of the fine shallow water equations, with much smaller computational times. However, small-scale phenomena are not captured by this type of model. Therefore, we seek to formulate a numerical model coupling the fine and upscaled ones, in order to obtain more accurate solutions inside the urban zone, always with reduced computational costs relatively to the simulation of the fine model. The guideline for this objective lays on the use of predictor-corrector iterative parallel-in-time numerical methods, which naturally fit to this fine/coarse formulation. We focus on the parareal, one of the most popular parallel-in-time methods. As a main challenge, temporal parallelization suffers from instabilities and/or slow convergence when applied to hyperbolic or advection-dominated problems, such as the shallow water equations. Therefore, we consider a variant of the method using reduced-order models (ROMs) formulated on-the-fly along parareal iterations, using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and the Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM), being able to improve the stability and convergence of the parareal method for solving nonlinear hyperbolic problems. We investigate the limitations of this ROM-based parareal method and we propose a number of modifications that provide further stability and convergence improvements: enrichment of the input snapshot sets used for the model reduction procedure; formulation of local-in-time ROMs; and incorporation of an adaptive parareal approach recently presented in the literature. The original and ROM-based parareal methods, including the proposed improvements, are compared and evaluated in terms of stability, convergence towards the fine solution and numerical speedup obtained in a parallel implementation. In a first part, the methods are formulated, studied and implemented considering a set of numerical simulations coupling the classical shallow water equations (without the porosity concept) at different scales. After this initial study, we implement them for coupling the classical and the porosity-based shallow water models, for the simulation of urban floods.},

This method is a variant of the traditional parareal method, first introduced by [22], that improves the stability and convergence for nonlinear hyperbolic problems, and uses reduced-order models constructed via the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition - Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (POD-DEIM) applied to snapshots of the solution of the parareal iterations. We propose a modification of this parareal method for further stability and convergence improvements. It consists in enriching the snapshots set for the POD-DEIM procedure with extra snapshots whose computation does not require any additional computational cost. The performances of the classical parareal method, the POD-DEIM-based parareal method and our proposed modification are compared using numerical tests with increasing complexity. Our modified method shows a more stable behaviour and converges in fewer iterations than the other two methods.},

Reformulating the original Parareal algorithm as a variational method and implementing a finite element discretization in space enables an adjoint-based a posteriori error analysis to be performed. Through an appropriate choice of adjoint problems and residuals the error analysis distinguishes between errors arising due to the temporal and spatial discretizations, as well as between the errors arising due to incomplete Parareal iterations and incomplete iterations of the domain decomposition solver. We first develop an error analysis for the Parareal method applied to parabolic partial differential equations, and then refine this analysis to the case where the associated spatial problems are solved using overlapping domain decomposition. These constitute our Time Parallel Algorithm (TPA) and Space-Time Parallel Algorithm (STPA) respectively. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the estimator for both algorithms and the iterations between distinct components of the error.},

@unpublished{GanderEtAl2021,
	abstract = {In 2008, Maday and R{\o}nquist introduce{d} an interesting new approach for the direct parallel-in-time (PinT) {solution} of
time-dependent PDEs. The idea is to diagonalize the time stepping matrix, keeping the matrices for the space discretization
unchanged, and then to solve all time steps in parallel. Since then, several variants appeared, and we 
call these closely related algorithms {\em ParaDiag} algorithms. ParaDiag algorithms in the literature can 
be classified into two groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item ParaDiag-I: direct standalone solvers,
\item ParaDiag-II:  iterative solvers.
\end{itemize}
We will explain the basic features of each group in this note. To have concrete examples, we will 
introduce ParaDiag-I and ParaDiag-II for the advection-diffusion equation. We will also introduce   
ParaDiag-II  for the wave equation  and an optimal control problem for the wave equation. 
We could have used the advection-diffusion equation as well to illustrate ParaDiag-II,
but wave equations are known to cause problems for certain PinT algorithms and thus constitute an 
especially interesting example for which ParaDiag algorithms were tested. We show the main known
theoretical results in each case, and also provide Matlab codes for testing.  The goal of the Matlab 
codes is to help the interested reader understand the key features of the ParaDiag algorithms, 
without intention to be highly tuned for efficiency and/or low  memory use.

We also provide speedup measurements of ParaDiag algorithms for a 2D linear advection-diffusion equation.  
These results are obtained on the Tianhe-1 supercomputer in China and the SIUE Campus Cluster in the US, 
which is a multi-array, configurable and cooperative parallel system, and we compare these results to the 
performance of parareal and MGRiT, two widely used PinT algorithms.  In a forthcoming update of this note, 
we will {provide} more material on ParaDiag algorithms, in particular further  Matlab codes and parallel 
computing results, also for more realistic applications.},

The matching-Schur-complement preconditioner has been extensively studied in literature and the implementation of this preconditioner lies in solving the underlying PDEs twice, sequentially in time. In this paper, we propose a new preconditioner for the Schur complement, which can be used parallel-in-time (PinT) via the so called diagonalization technique. We show that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are low and upper bounded by positive constants independent of matrix size and the regularization parameter. The uniform boundedness of the eigenvalues leads to an optimal linear convergence rate of conjugate gradient solver for the preconditioned Schur complement system. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to have an optimal convergence analysis for a PinT preconditioning technique of the optimal control problem. Numerical results are reported to show that the performance of the proposed preconditioner is robust with respect to the discretization step-sizes and the regularization parameter.},

	abstract = {The Sinc-Nystr\"{o}m method in time is a high-order spectral method for solving evolutionary differential equations and it has wide applications in scientific computation. But in this method we have to solve all the time steps implicitly at one-shot, which may results in a large-scale nonsymmetric dense system that is expensive to solve. In this paper, we propose and analyze a parallel-in-time (PinT) preconditioner for solving such Sinc-Nystr\"{o}m systems, where both the parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs are investigated. Attributed to the special Toeplitz-like structure of the Sinc-Nystr\"{o}m systems, the proposed PinT preconditioner is indeed a low-rank perturbation of the system matrix and we show that the spectrum of the preconditioned system is highly clustered around one, especially when the time step size is refined. Such a clustered spectrum distribution matches very well with the numerically observed mesh-independent GMRES convergence rates in various examples. Several linear and nonlinear ODE and PDE examples are presented to illustrate the convergence performance of our proposed PinT preconditioners, where the achieved exponential order of accuracy are especially attractive to those applications in need of high accuracy.},

@unpublished{WuEtAl2021b,
	abstract = {Solving evolutionary equations in a parallel-in-time manner is an attractive topic and many algorithms are proposed in recent two decades. The algorithm based on the block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioning technique has shown promising  advantages,  especially for wave propagation problems. By fast Fourier transform for factorizing the involved circulant matrices, the preconditioned iteration can be computed efficiently via the so-called diagonalization technique, which yields a direct parallel implementation across all time levels. In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring  the convergence of the preconditioned iteration 
by studying the spectral radius of the iteration matrix, and this leads to many case-by-case studies depending on the used time-integrator. In this paper,  we propose a unified convergence analysis for the algorithm applied to $u'+Au=f$,  where   $\sigma(A)\subset\mathbb{C}^+$ with $\sigma(A)$ being  the spectrum of $A\in\mathbb{C}^{m\times m}$. For any   one-step method (such as the Runge-Kutta methods) with stability function $\mathcal{R}(z)$,  we prove  that the decay rate of the global error is bounded by $\alpha/(1-\alpha)$, provided the  method is stable, i.e., $\max_{\lambda\in\sigma(A)}|\mathcal{R}(\Delta t\lambda)|\leq1$. For any linear multistep method, such a bound becomes $c\alpha/(1-c\alpha)$, where $c\geq1$ is a constant specified by the multistep method itself. 
Our proof only relies on  the stability of the time-integrator and the estimate is independent of the step size $\Delta t$ and  the   spectrum $\sigma(A)$.},

In this paper, we first propose a second-order scheme for this equation by employing the recently proposed L2-type formula [A.~A.~Alikhanov, C.~Huang, Appl.~Math.~Comput.~(2021) 126545]. Then, we prove the stability and the convergence of this scheme. Based on such the numerical scheme, a L2-type all-at-once system is derived. In order to solve this system in a parallel-in-time pattern, a bilateral preconditioning technique is designed according to the special structure of the system. We theoretically show that the condition number of the preconditioned matrix is uniformly bounded by a constant for the time fractional order $\alpha \in (0,0.3624)$.

Given an initial state and a sequence of controls, the problem of predicting the resulting sequence of states is a key component of a variety of model-based planning and control algorithms. We propose combining a coarse (i.e. computationally cheap but not very accurate) predictive physics model, with a fine (i.e. computationally expensive but accurate) predictive physics model, to generate a hybrid model that is at the required speed and accuracy for a given manipulation task. Our approach is based on the Parareal algorithm, a parallel-in-time integration method used for computing numerical solutions for general systems of ordinary differential equations. We use Parareal to combine a coarse pushing model with an off-the-shelf physics engine to deliver physics-based predictions that are as accurate as the physics engine but runs in substantially less wall-clock time, thanks to Parareal being amenable to parallelization. We use these physics-based predictions in a model-predictive-control framework based on trajectory optimization, to plan pushing actions that avoid an obstacle and reach a goal location. We show that by combining the two physics models, we can achieve the same success rates as the planner that uses the off-the-shelf physics engine directly, but significantly faster. We present experiments in simulation and on a real robotic setup.}},

The resulting macro-scale problem for the plaque growth can be further accelerated by using parallel time integration schemes, such as the parareal algorithm. However, the parallel scalability is dominated by the computational cost of the coarse propagator. Therefore, in this paper, an interpolation-based coarse propagator, which uses growth values from previously computed micro-scale problems, is introduced. For a simple model problem, it is shown that this approach reduces both the computational work for a single parareal iteration as well as the required number of parareal iterations.},

These methods have been described using different notations and the convergence estimates that are available for some of them are difficult to compare. We describe Parareal, PFASST, MGRIT and STMG for the Dahlquist model problem using a common notation and give precise convergence estimates using generating functions. This allows us, for the first time, to directly compare their convergence. We prove that all four methods eventually converge super-linearly and compare them directly numerically.

Lelievre and U. Sharma, SISC 2022]. We focus here on test cases of physical interest where the dynamics of the system is modelled by the Langevin equation and is simulated using the molecular dynamics software LAMMPS. In this work, the parareal algorithm uses a family of machine-learning spectral neighbor analysis potentials (SNAP) as fine, reference, potentials and embedded-atom method potentials (EAM) as coarse potentials. We consider a self-interstitial atom in a tungsten lattice and compute the average residence time of the system in metastable states. Our numerical results demonstrate significant computational gains using the adaptive parareal algorithm in comparison to a sequential integration of the Langevin dynamics.

Such matrix equations have been considered, for example, in the context of parallel-in-time integration leading to a class of algorithms called ParaDiag. We develop and analyze two novel approaches for the numerical solution of such equations. Our first approach is based on the observation that the modification of these equations performed by ParaDiag in order to solve them in parallel has low rank. Building upon previous work on low-rank updates of matrix equations, this allows us to make use of tensorized Krylov subspace methods to account for the modification. Our second approach is based on interpolating the solution of the matrix equation from the solutions of several modifications. Both approaches avoid the use of iterative refinement needed by ParaDiag and related space-time approaches in order to attain good accuracy. In turn, our new approaches have the potential to outperform, sometimes significantly, existing approaches. This potential is demonstrated for several different types of PDEs.},

	abstract = {Parallelizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks is a challenging task, as the training procedure of GRU is inherently sequential. Prior efforts to parallelize GRU have largely focused on conventional parallelization strategies such as data-parallel and model-parallel training algorithms. However, when the given sequences are very long, existing approaches are still inevitably performance limited in terms of training time. In this paper, we present a novel parallel training scheme (called parallel-in-time) for GRU based on a multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) solver. MGRIT partitions a sequence into multiple shorter sub-sequences and trains the sub-sequences on different processors in parallel. The key to achieving speedup is a hierarchical correction of the hidden state to accelerate end-to-end communication in both the forward and backward propagation phases of gradient descent. Experimental results on the HMDB51 dataset, where each video is an image sequence, demonstrate that the new parallel training scheme achieves up to 6.5$\times$ speedup over a serial approach. As efficiency of our new parallelization strategy is associated with the sequence length, our parallel GRU algorithm achieves significant performance improvement as the sequence length increases.},

The climate model provides one time integration method and hence, the coarse and fine propagators were defined by time step width. The coarse method was executed at the CFL condition limit, while fine step-sizes where gradually refined. As a first assessment of the performance of Parareal a low-resolution test mesh was used with default settings provided by the AWI. An introduction to FESOM2 and the straightforward implementation of Parareal on the DKRZ cluster is given. The evaluation of numerical results for different simulation intervals and fine propagator configurations shows strong dependence on the simulation time and time step-size of the fine propagator. Increasing the latter leads to stagnation and eventually divergence of the Parareal algorithm.},

We give an asymptotic error estimate which reduces to the two-level estimate for the case when only two levels are considered. Introducing more than two levels has important consequences for the averaging procedure, as we choose separate averaging windows for each of the different levels, which is an additional new feature of the present study. The different averaging windows make the proposed method especially appropriate for multi-scale problems, because we can introduce a level for each intrinsic scale of the problem and adapt the averaging procedure such that we reproduce the behavior of the model on the particular scale resolved by the level.},

We divide the time interval of the control problem into sub-intervals, and define a control problem in each sub-interval, conditioned on the start and end states, leading to conditional value functions for the sub-intervals. By defining an associative operator as the minimisation of the sum of conditional value functions, we obtain the elements and associative operators for a parallel associative scan operation. This allows for solving the optimal control problem on the whole time interval in parallel in logarithmic time complexity in the number of sub-intervals. We derive the HJB-type of backward and forward equations for the conditional value functions and solve them in closed form for linear quadratic problems. We also discuss other numerical methods for computing the conditional value functions and present closed form solutions for selected special cases. The computational advantages of the proposed parallel methods are demonstrated via simulations run on a multi-core central processing unit and a graphics processing unit.},

We consider the application of the multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT) algorithm to linear advection PDEs. The key to efficient time integration with this method is using a coarse-grid operator that provides a sufficiently accurate approximation to the the so-called ideal coarse-grid operator. For certain classes of semi-Lagrangian discretizations, we present a novel semi-Lagrangian-based coarse-grid operator that leads to fast and scalable multilevel time integration of linear advection PDEs. The coarse-grid operator is composed of a semi-Lagrangian discretization followed by a correction term, with the correction designed so that the leading-order truncation error of the composite operator is approximately equal to that of the ideal coarse-grid operator. Parallel results show substantial speed-ups over sequential time integration for variable-wave-speed advection problems in one and two spatial dimensions, and using high-order discretizations up to order five. The proposed approach establishes the first practical method that provides small and scalable MGRIT iteration counts for advection problems.},

	abstract = {A long-standing issue in the parallel-in-time community is the poor convergence of standard iterative parallel-in-time methods for hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), and for advection-dominated PDEs more broadly. Here, a local Fourier analysis (LFA) convergence theory is derived for the two-level variant of the iterative parallel-in-time method of multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT). This closed-form theory allows for new insights into the poor convergence of MGRIT for advection-dominated PDEs when using the standard approach of rediscretizing the fine-grid problem on the coarse grid. Specifically, we show that this poor convergence arises, at least in part, from inadequate coarse-grid correction of certain smooth Fourier modes known as characteristic components, which was previously identified as causing poor convergence of classical spatial multigrid on steady-state advection-dominated PDEs. We apply this convergence theory to show that, for certain semi-Lagrangian discretizations of advection problems, MGRIT convergence using rediscretized coarse-grid operators cannot be robust with respect to CFL number or coarsening factor. A consequence of this analysis is that techniques developed for improving convergence in the spatial multigrid context can be re-purposed in the MGRIT context to develop more robust parallel-in-time solvers. This strategy has been used in recent work to great effect; here, we provide further theoretical evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach.},

	abstract = {Parallel-in-time methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) have been the subject of intense development over recent decades, particularly for diffusion-dominated problems. It has been widely reported in the literature, however, that many of these methods perform quite poorly for advection-dominated problems. Here we analyze the particular iterative parallel-in-time algorithm of multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT) for discretizations of constant-wave-speed linear advection problems. We focus on common method-of-lines discretizations that employ upwind finite differences in space and Runge-Kutta methods in time. Using a convergence framework we developed in previous work, we prove for a subclass of these discretizations that, if using the standard approach of rediscretizing the fine-grid problem on the coarse grid, robust MGRIT convergence with respect to CFL number and coarsening factor is not possible. This poor convergence and non-robustness is caused, at least in part, by an inadequate coarse-grid correction for smooth Fourier modes known as characteristic components.We propose an alternative coarse-grid that provides a better correction of these modes. This coarse-grid operator is related to previous work and uses a semi-Lagrangian discretization combined with an implicitly treated truncation error correction. Theory and numerical experiments show the coarse-grid operator yields fast MGRIT convergence for many of the method-of-lines discretizations considered, including for both implicit and explicit discretizations of high order.},

In the context of optimal control of linear parabolic PDEs, the state-of-the-art ParaDiag method is limited to solving self-adjoint problems with a tracking objective. We propose three improvements to the ParaDiag method: the use of alpha-circulant matrices to construct an alternative preconditioner, a generalization of the algorithm for solving non-self-adjoint equations, and the formulation of an algorithm for terminal-cost objectives. We present novel analytic results about the eigenvalues of the preconditioned systems for all discussed ParaDiag algorithms in the case of self-adjoint equations, which proves the favorable properties the alpha-circulant preconditioner. We use these results to perform a theoretical parallel-scaling analysis of ParaDiag for self-adjoint problems. Numerical tests confirm our findings and suggest that the self-adjoint behavior, which is backed by theory, generalizes to the non-self-adjoint case. We provide a sequential, open-source reference solver in Matlab for all discussed algorithms.},

We reformulate ParaOpt for tracking problems and provide generalized convergence analyses for both objectives. We focus on linear diffusive equations and prove convergence bounds that are generic in the time integrators used. For large problem dimensions, ParaOpt's performance depends crucially on having a good preconditioner to solve the arising linear systems. For the case where ParaOpt's cheap, coarse-grained propagator is linear, we introduce diagonalization-based preconditioners, inspired by recent advances in the ParaDiag family of methods. These preconditioners not only lead to a weakly-scalable ParaOpt version, but are themselves invertible in parallel, making maximal use of available concurrency. They have proven convergence properties in the linear diffusive case that are generic in the time discretization used, similarly to our ParaOpt results. Numerical results confirm that the iteration count of the iterative solvers used for ParaOpt's linear systems becomes constant in the limit of an increasing processor count. The paper is accompanied by a sequential MATLAB implementation.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing interest in parallel-in-time methods as an approach to accelerate numerical simulations in atmospheric modelling, improving their stability and convergence remains a substantial challenge for their application to operational models. In this work, we study the temporal parallelization of the shallow water equations on the rotating sphere combined with time-stepping schemes commonly used in atmospheric modelling due to their stability properties, namely an Eulerian implicit-explicit (IMEX) method and a semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method (SL-SI-SETTLS). The main goal is to investigate the performance of parallel-in-time methods, namely Parareal and Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT), when these well-established schemes are used on the coarse discretization levels and provide insights on how they can be improved for better performance. We begin by performing an analytical stability study of Parareal and MGRIT applied to a linearized ordinary differential equation depending on the choice of coarse scheme. Next, we perform numerical simulations of two standard tests to evaluate the stability, convergence and speedup provided by the parallel-in-time methods compared to a fine reference solution computed serially. We also conduct a detailed investigation on the influence of artificial viscosity and hyperviscosity approaches, applied on the coarse discretization levels, on the performance of the temporal parallelization. Both the analytical stability study and the numerical simulations indicate a poorer stability behaviour when SL-SI-SETTLS is used on the coarse levels, compared to the IMEX scheme. With the IMEX scheme, a better trade-off between convergence, stability and speedup compared to serial simulations can be obtained under proper parameters and artificial viscosity choices, opening the perspective of the potential competitiveness for realistic models.},

Our approach leverages the observation that the Schur-complement is elliptic in time, and thus amenable to classical domain decomposition methods. Further, the application of the preconditioner uses existing time integration routines to facilitate implementation and maximize software reuse.

	abstract = {This work develops a novel all-at-once space-time preconditioning approach for resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), with a focus on model problems targeting fusion reactor design. We consider parallel-in-time due to the long time domains required to capture the physics of interest, as well as the complexity of the underlying system and thereby computational cost of long-time integration. To ameliorate this cost by using many processors, we thus develop a novel approach to solving the whole space-time system that is parallelizable in both space and time. We develop a space-time block preconditioning for resistive MHD, following the space-time block preconditioning concept first introduced by Danieli et al. in 2022 for incompressible flow, where an effective preconditioner for classic sequential time-stepping is extended to the space-time setting. The starting point for our derivation is the continuous Schur complement preconditioner by Cyr et al. in 2021, which we proceed to generalise in order to produce, to our knowledge, the first space-time block preconditioning approach for the challenging equations governing incompressible resistive MHD. The numerical results are promising for the model problems of island coalescence and tearing mode, with the overhead computational cost associated with space-time preconditioning versus sequential time-stepping being modest and primarily in the range of 2x-5x, which is low for parallel-in-time schemes in general. Additionally, the scaling results for inner (linear) and outer (nonlinear) iterations are flat in the case of fixed time-step size and only grow very slowly in the case of time-step refinement.},

In this paper, we present novel data-driven methods aimed at improving the standard parareal algorithm developed by Lion, Maday, and Turinici in 2001, for multiscale Hamiltonian systems. The first method involves constructing a correction operator to improve a given inaccurate coarse solver through solving a Procrustes problem using data collected online along parareal trajectories. The second method involves constructing an efficient, high-fidelity solver by a neural network trained with offline generated data. For the second method, we address the issues of effective data generation and proper loss function design based on the Hamiltonian function. We show proof-of-concept by applying the proposed methods to a Fermi-Pasta-Ulum (FPU) problem. The numerical results demonstrate that the Procrustes parareal method is able to produce solutions that are more stable in energy compared to the standard parareal. The neural network solver can achieve comparable or better runtime performance compared to numerical solvers of similar accuracy. When combined with the standard parareal algorithm, the improved neural network solutions are slightly more stable in energy than the improved numerical coarse solutions.},

Indeed, it has been shown that parallel-in-time techniques have the potential to remedy one of the main computational drawbacks of parallel-in-space solvers. In particular, it is well-known that for large-scale evolution problems space parallelization saturates long before all processing cores are effectively used on today's large scale parallel computers. Among the many approaches for time-parallel time integration, ParaDiag schemes have proved themselves to be a very effective approach. In this framework, the time stepping matrix or an approximation thereof is diagonalized by Fourier techniques, so that computations taking place at different time steps can be indeed carried out in parallel. We propose here a new ParaDiag algorithm combining the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula and Krylov techniques. A panel of diverse numerical examples illustrates the potential of our new solver. In particular, we show that it performs very well compared to different ParaDiag algorithms recently proposed in the literature.},

	abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel preconditioned Krylov subspace method for solving an optimal control problem of wave equations, after explicitly identifying the asymptotic spectral distribution of the involved sequence of linear coefficient matrices from the optimal control problem. Namely, we first show that the all-at-once system stemming from the wave control problem is associated to a structured coefficient matrix-sequence possessing an eigenvalue distribution. Then, based on such a spectral distribution of which the symbol is explicitly identified, we develop an ideal preconditioner and two parallel-in-time preconditioners for the saddle point system composed of two block Toeplitz matrices. For the ideal preconditioner, we show that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix-sequence all belong to the set $\left(-\frac{3}{2},-\frac{1}{2}\right)\bigcup \left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right)$ well separated from zero, leading to mesh-independent convergence when the minimal residual method is employed. The proposed {parallel-in-time} preconditioners can be implemented efficiently using fast Fourier transforms or discrete sine transforms, and their effectiveness is theoretically shown in the sense that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix-sequences are clustered around $\pm 1$, which leads to rapid convergence. When these parallel-in-time preconditioners are not fast diagonalizable, we further propose modified versions which can be efficiently inverted. Several numerical examples are reported to verify our derived localization and spectral distribution result and to support the effectiveness of our proposed preconditioners and the related advantages with respect to the relevant literature.},

	abstract = {In this article, we derive fast and robust preconditioned iterative methods for the all-at-once linear systems arising upon discretization of time-dependent PDEs. The discretization we employ is based on a Runge--Kutta method in time, for which the development of robust solvers is an emerging research area in the literature of numerical methods for time-dependent PDEs. By making use of classical theory of block matrices, one is able to derive a preconditioner for the systems considered. An approximate inverse of the preconditioner so derived consists in a fixed number of linear solves for the system of the stages of the method. We thus propose a preconditioner for the latter system based on a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the (real) Runge--Kutta matrix $A_{\mathrm{RK}} = U \Sigma V^\top$. Supposing $A_{\mathrm{RK}}$ is invertible, we prove that the spectrum of the system for the stages preconditioned by our SVD-based preconditioner is contained within the right-half of the unit circle, under suitable assumptions on the matrix $U^\top V$ (which is well defined due to the polar decomposition of $A_{\mathrm{RK}}$). We show the numerical efficiency of our SVD-based preconditioner by solving the system of the stages arising from the discretization of the heat equation and the Stokes equations, with sequential time-stepping. Finally, we provide numerical results of the all-at-once approach for both problems.},

@unpublished{LinEtAl2023,
	abstract = {In this work, we propose an absolute value block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner for the minimal residual (MINRES) method to solve an all-at-once system arising from the discretization of wave equations. Since the original block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner shown successful by many recently is non-Hermitian in general, it cannot be directly used as a preconditioner for MINRES. Motivated by the absolute value block circulant preconditioner proposed in [E. McDonald, J. Pestana, and A. Wathen. SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 40(2):A1012-A1033, 2018], we propose an absolute value version of the block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner. Our proposed preconditioner is the first Hermitian positive definite variant of the block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner, which fills the gap between block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioning and the field of preconditioned MINRES solver. The matrix-vector multiplication of the preconditioner can be fast implemented via fast Fourier transforms. Theoretically, we show that for properly chosen $\alpha$ the MINRES solver with the proposed preconditioner has a linear convergence rate independent of the matrix size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generalize the original absolute value block circulant preconditioner in the aspects of both theory and performance. Numerical experiments are given to support the effectiveness of our preconditioner, showing that the expected optimal convergence can be achieved.},

	abstract = {A micro-macro variant of the parallel-in-time algorithm Parareal has been applied to the ocean-circulation and sea-ice model model FESOM2. The state-of-the-art software in climate research has been developed by the Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI) in Bremen, Germany. The algorithm requires two meshes of low and high spatial resolution to define the coarse and fine propagator. As a first assessment we refined the PI mesh, increasing its resolution by factor 4. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate that micro-macro Parareal can provide convergence in diagnostic variables in complex climate research problems. After the introduction to FESOM2 we show how to generate the refined mesh and which interpolation methods were chosen. With the convergence results presented we discuss the success of this attempt and which steps have to be taken to extend the approach to current research problems.},

	abstract = {In this paper the Micro-Macro Parareal algorithm was adapted to PDEs. The parallel-in-time approach requires two meshes of different spatial resolution in order to compute approximations in an iterative way to a predefined reference solution. When fast convergence in few iterations can be accomplished the algorithm is able to generate wall-time reduction in comparison to the serial computation. We chose the laminar flow around a cylinder benchmark on 2-dimensional domain which was simulated with the open-source software OpenFoam. The numerical experiments presented in this work aim to approximate states local in time and space and the diagnostic lift coefficient. The Reynolds number is gradually increased from 100 to 1,000, before the transition to turbulent flows sets in. After the results are presented the convergence behavior is discussed with respect to the Reynolds number and the applied interpolation schemes.},

The adjoint method is the method of choice to calculate the sensitivities in a many-parameter setting. In order to obtain sensitivity information that is time-dependent, multiple adjoint problems must be solved. This slows down the simulation wall-clock time and leaves a large optimization potential for the analysis. The parareal is applied to the adjoint solution, significantly speeding up the adjoint solution for every timestep respectively.},

@unpublished{SteinstraesserEtAl2023,
	abstract = {Despite the growing interest in parallel-in-time methods as an approach to accelerate numerical simulations in atmospheric modelling, improving their stability and convergence remains a substantial challenge for their application to operational models. In this work, we study the temporal parallelization of the shallow water equations on the rotating sphere combined with time-stepping schemes commonly used in atmospheric modelling due to their stability properties, namely an Eulerian implicit-explicit (IMEX) method and a semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method (SL-SI-SETTLS). The main goal is to investigate the performance of parallel-in-time methods, namely Parareal and Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT), when these well-established schemes are used on the coarse discretization levels and provide insights on how they can be improved for better performance. We begin by performing an analytical stability study of Parareal and MGRIT applied to a linearized ordinary differential equation depending on the choice of coarse scheme. Next, we perform numerical simulations of two standard tests to evaluate the stability, convergence and speedup provided by the parallel-in-time methods compared to a fine reference solution computed serially. We also conduct a detailed investigation on the influence of artificial viscosity and hyperviscosity approaches, applied on the coarse discretization levels, on the performance of the temporal parallelization. Both the analytical stability study and the numerical simulations indicate a poorer stability behaviour when SL-SI-SETTLS is used on the coarse levels, compared to the IMEX scheme. With the IMEX scheme, a better trade-off between convergence, stability and speedup compared to serial simulations can be obtained under proper parameters and artificial viscosity choices, opening the perspective of the potential competitiveness for realistic models.},

Focusing on a uniform discretization of the $d$-dimensional advection-diffusion equation, our proposal is a two-level algorithm that merges the solutions obtained from the discretization of the equation over highly anisotropic submeshes to compute an initial approximation of the fine solution. The algorithm then iteratively refines the initial guess by leveraging the structure of the residual. Performing costly calculations on anisotropic submeshes enable us to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by one, and the merging process, which involves the computation of solutions over disjoint domains, allows for parallel implementation.},

As far as we know, this is the first time that the spectral method used as the F propagator of the parareal algorithm. By constructing the stable function of the Chebyshev-Gauss spectral collocation method for the symmetric positive definite (SPD) problem, we find out that the Parareal-CG algorithm and the Parareal-TR algorithm, whose F propagator is chosen to be a trapezoidal ruler, converge similarly, i.e., the Parareal-CG algorithm converge as fast as Parareal-Euler algorithm with sufficient Chebyhsev-Gauss points in every coarse grid. Numerical examples including ordinary differential equations and time-dependent partial differential equations are given to illustrate the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.},
