	abstract = {{Peer two-step W-methods are designed for integration of stiff initial value problems with parallelism
		across the method.
		The essential feature is that in each time step $s$ 'peer' approximations are employed having similar properties.
		In fact, no primary solution variable is distinguished.
		Parallel implementation of these stages is easy since information from one previous time step is used only and
		the different linear systems may be solved simultaneously.
		This paper introduces a subclass having order $s-1$ where optimal damping for stiff problems is obtained by using
		different system parameters in different stages.
		Favourable properties of this subclass are uniform stability for realistic stepsize sequences and a
		superconvergence property which is proved using a polynomial collocation formulation.

	abstract = {{'Parareal' attempts to speed up the solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by
		parallelizing the time dimension.
		Different solutions are obtained in parallel on different subintervals.
		An iterative procedure is employed to match the solution values at the end of each subinterval with
		those at the beginning of the next one.
		It has been shown that insufficient 'parareal' iterations lead to an inaccurate solution, while too
		many iterations waste CPU cycles without bringing any improvement to the solution.
		In this paper we discuss an error control mechanism for both the classical 'parareal' time
		discretization method and its adaptive variant.
		This mechanism can be effectively used as a mean of controlling the number of 'parareal' iterations.
		We show that bounding the difference between the solution of the fine integrator and the 'parareal'
		solution by the local truncation error of the fine grid leads to a sufficient convergence criterion that
		guaranties a solution that is accurate enough in a minimum number of iterations.
		Tests on a nonlinear problem illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed error control mechanism on
		the classical automatic adaptive time stepping formulation of an embedded method on the two-level
		'parareal' algorithm.}},

		equation over a finite control horizon.
		We consider an "all at once" discretization of the problem and formulate three iterative algorithms.
		The first algorithm is based on preconditioning a symmetric positive definite reduced linear system
		involving only the unknown control variables; however inner-outer iterations are required.
		The second algorithm modifies the first algorithm to avoid inner-outer iterations by introducing an
		auxiliary variable.
		It yields a symmetric indefinite system with a positive definite block preconditioner.
		The third algorithm is the central focus of this paper.
		It modifies the preconditioner in the second algorithm by a parallel-in-time preconditioner based on
		the parareal algorithm.
		Theoretical results show that the preconditioned algorithms have optimal convergence properties and
		parallel scalability.

	abstract = {{The applicability of the Parareal parallel-in-time integration scheme for the solution of a linear,
		two-dimensional hyperbolic acoustic-advection system, which is often used as a test case for integration schemes
		for numerical weather prediction (NWP), is addressed.
		Parallel-in-time schemes are a possible way to increase, on the algorithmic level, the amount of parallelism, a
		requirement arising from the rapidly growing number of CPUs in high performance computer systems.
		A recently introduced modification of the "parallel implicit time-integration algorithm" could successfully
		solve hyperbolic problems arising in structural dynamics.
		It has later been cast into the framework of Parareal.
		The present paper adapts this modified Parareal and employs it for the solution of a hyperbolic flow problem,
		where the initial value problem solved in parallel arises from the spatial discretization of a partial
		differential equation by a finite difference method.
		It is demonstrated that the modified Parareal is stable and can produce reasonably accurate solutions while
		allowing for a noticeable reduction of the time-to-solution.
		The implementation relies on integration schemes already widely used in NWP (RK-3, partially split forward
		Euler, forward-backward).
		It is demonstrated that using an explicit partially split scheme for the coarse integrator allows to avoid the
		use of an implicit scheme while still achieving speedup.}},

		Parallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space and Time.
		The naive use of increasingly more processors for a fixed-size N-body problem is prone to saturate as soon as
		the number of unknowns per core becomes too small.
		To overcome this intrinsic strong-scaling limit, we introduce temporal parallelism on top of pepc's existing
		hybrid MPI/PThreads spatial decomposition.
		Here, we use PFASST which is based on a combination of the iterations of the parallel-in-time algorithm parareal
		with the sweeps of spectral deferred correction (SDC) schemes.
		By combining these sweeps with multiple space-time discretization levels, PFASST relaxes the theoretical bound
		on parallel efficiency in parareal.
		We present results from runs on up to 262,144 cores on the IBM Blue Gene/P installation JUGENE, demonstrating
		that the space-time parallel code provides speedup beyond the saturation of the purely space-parallel approach.}},

Because time is sequential in nature, the idea of simultaneously solving along time steps is not intuitive. One approach to achieve parallelism in time direction is MGRIT algorithm [7], based on multigrid reduction (MGR) techniques. Here we refer to this approach as MGR-1D. Other kind of approach is the space-time multigrid, where time is simply another dimension in the grid. Analougsly, we refer to this approach as MGR-4D. In this work, motivated by the need of maximizing the availability of new algorithms to climate science, we propose a new parallel approach that mixes both the MGR-1D idea and classical space multigrid methods. We refer to it as the MGR3D+1 approach. Moreover, we discuss their implementation in the high performance scientific library PETSc, as starting point to develope more efficient and scalable algorithms in ocean models.}},

	abstract = {{Time parallel time integration methods have received renewed interest over the last decade because of
		the advent of massively parallel computers, which is mainly due to the clock speed limit reached on today's
		processors.
		When solving time dependent partial differential equations, the time direction is usually not used for
		parallelization.
		But when parallelization in space saturates, the time direction offers itself as a further direction for
		parallelization.
		The time direction is however special, and for evolution problems there is a causality principle: the solution
		later in time is affected (it is even determined) by the solution earlier in time, but not the other way round.
		Algorithms trying to use the time direction for parallelization must therefore be special, and take this very
		different property of the time dimension into account.
		We show in this chapter how time domain decomposition methods were invented, and give an overview of the
		existing techniques.
		Time parallel methods can be classified into four different groups: methods based on multiple shooting, methods
		based on domain decomposition and waveform relaxation, space-time multigrid methods and direct time parallel
		methods.
		We show for each of these techniques the main inventions over time by choosing specific publications and
		explaining the core ideas of the authors.

The idea is to explicitly construct an approximation to the time-evolution operator $\exp (\tau \mathcal {L})$ for a relatively large time-step $\tau $. Recently developed techniques for approximating oscillatory scalar functions by rational functions, and accelerated algorithms for computing functions of discretized differential operators are exploited. Principal advantages of the proposed method include: stability even for large time-steps, the possibility to parallelize in time over many characteristic wavelengths and large speed-ups over existing methods in situations where simulation over long times are required. Numerical examples involving the 2D rotating shallow water equations and the 2D wave equation in an inhomogenous medium are presented, and the method is compared to the 4th order Runge?Kutta (RK4) method and to the use of Chebyshev polynomials.

Its numerical calculation is one time-consuming step within the numerical prediction of the air quality. The widely used parallelization strategies only allow a limited potential level of parallelism. A higher level of parallelism within the codes will be necessary to enable benefits from future exa-scale computing architectures. In air quality prediction codes, chemical kinetics is typically considered to react in isolated boxes over short splitting intervals. This allows their trivial parallelization in space, which however is limited by the number of grid entities. This work pursues a parallelization beyond this trivial potential and investigates a parallelization across time using the so called ``parareal algorithm''. The latter is an iterative prediction-correction scheme, whose efficiency strongly depends on the choice of the predictor. For that purpose, different options are being investigate and compared: Time-stepping schemes with fixed step size, adaptive time-stepping schemes and repro-models, functional representations, that map a given state to a later state in time. Only the choice of repromodels leads to a speed-up through parallelism, compared to the sequential reference for the scenarios considered here.}},

        abstract={{We describe an approach to solving a generic time-dependent differential equation (DE) that recasts the problem as a functional optimization one. The techniques employed to solve for the functional minimum, which we relate to the Sobolev Gradient method, allow for large-scale parallelization in time, and therefore potential faster ``wall-clock'' time computing on machines with significant parallel computing capacity. We are able to come up with numerous different discretizations and approximations for our optimization-derived equations, each of which either puts an existing approach, the Parareal method, in an optimization context, or provides a new time-parallel (TP) scheme with potentially faster convergence to the DE solution. We describe how the approach is particularly effective for solving multiscale DEs and present TP schemes that incorporate two different solution scales. Sample results are provided for three differential equations, solved with TP schemes, and we discuss how the choice of TP scheme can have an orders of magnitude effect on the accuracy or convergence rate.}},

	abstract = {{Parallel-in-time integration is an often advocated approach for extracting parallelism in the solution of PDEs beyond what is possible using spacial domain decomposition tech- niques. Due to the comparatively low parallel efficiency of parallel-in-time integration techniques, they are primar- ily of interest as an extension for classical approaches at parallelism. As such, potential applications are expected to scale across several hundreds, or possibly thousands of nodes, making algorithmic resilience towards hardware in- duced errors highly relevant. In this work we develop a scheduling scheme for the parareal algorithm that is resilient to node-loss. The fault-tolerant scheme is based on a popu- lar approach introduced by E. Aubanel in [1], modified with a set of MPI interface extensions for implementing recov- ery strategies available in the ULFM framework. In ad- dition, we demonstrate how the parareal algorithm may be made resilient towards Silent-Data-Corruption (SDC) errors by viewing it as a point-iterative method, locally monitor- ing the residual between consecutive iterations so to discard potentially corrupt iterations.}}

@unpublished{SchreiberEtAl2016,
	abstract = {{AbstractThis paper presents, discusses and analyses a massively parallel-in-time solver for linear oscillatory PDEs, whichis a key numerical component for evolving weather, ocean, climate and seismic models. The time parallelization inthis solver allows us to significantly exceed the computing resources used by parallelization-in-space methods andresults in a correspondingly significantly reduced wall-clock time. One of the major difficulties of achieving Exascaleperformance for weather prediction is that the strong scaling limit ? the parallel performance for a fixed problem sizewith an increasing number of processors ? saturates. A main avenue to circumvent this problem is to introduce newnumerical techniques that take advantage of time parallelism. In this paper we use a time-parallel approximation thatretains the frequency information of oscillatory problems. This approximation is based on (a) reformulating the originalproblem into a large set of independent terms and (b) solving each of these terms independent of each other whichcan now be accomplished on a large number of HPC resources. Our results are conducted on up to 3586 cores forproblem sizes with a parallelization-in-space scalability limited already on a single node. We gain significant reductionsin the time-to-solution of 118.3 for spectral methods and 1503.0 for finite-difference methods with the parallelization-in-time approach. A developed and validated performance model gives the scalability limitations a-priory for this newapproach and allows us to extrapolate the performance method towards large-scale system. This work has the potentialto contribute as a basic building block of parallelization-in-time approaches, with possible major implications in appliedareas modelling oscillatory dominated problems.}},
