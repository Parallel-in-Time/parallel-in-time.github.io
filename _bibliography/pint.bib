It does not require solving any linear systems and is highly parallelizable. The two other methods proposed are based on Padé and Chebyshev approximations to the matrix exponential. The parallelization of these methods is achieved by using partial fraction decomposition techniques to solve the resulting systems and thus offers the potential for increased time parallelism in time dependent problems. We also present experimental results from the Alliant FX/8 and the Cray Y-MP/832 vector multiprocessors.}},

    abstract = {For the numerical integration of a stiff ordinary differential equation, fully implicit Runge-Kutta methods offer nice properties, like a high classical order and high stage order as well as an excellent stability behaviour. However, such methods need the solution of a set of highly coupled equations for the stage values and this is a considerable computational task. This paper discusses an iteration scheme to tackle this problem. By means of a suitable choice of the iteration parameters, the implicit relations for the stage values, as they occur in each iteration, can be uncoupled so that they can be solved in parallel. The resulting scheme can be cast into the class of Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) methods and, similar to these methods, requires only one LU factorization per step (per processor). The stability as well as the computational efficiency of the process strongly depends on the particular choice of the iteration parameters and on the number of iterations performed. We discuss several choices to obtain good stability and fast convergence. Based on these approaches, we wrote two codes possessing local error control and stepsize variation. We have implemented both codes on an ALLIANT FX/4 machine (four parallel vector processors and shared memory) and measured their speedup factors for a number of test problems. Furthermore, the performance of these codes is compared with the performance of the best stiff ODE codes for sequential computers, like SIMPLE, LSODE and RADAU5.}

    abstract = {In this paper, we analyze parallel, diagonally implicit iteration of Runge-Kutta methods (PDIRK methods) for solving large systems of stiff equations on parallel computers. Like Newton-iterated backward differentiation formulas (BDFs), these PDIRK methods are such that in each step the (sequential) costs consist of solving a number of linear systems with the same matrix of coefficients and with the same dimension as the system of differential equations. Although for PDIRK methods the number of linear systems is usually higher than for Newton iteration of BDFs, the more computationally intensive work of computing the matrix of coefficients and its LU-decomposition are identical. The advantage of PDIRK methods over Newton-iterated BDFs is their unconditional stability (A-stability for Gauss-based methods and L-stability for Radau-based methods) for any order of accuracy. Special characteristics of the PDIRK methods will be studied, such as the rate of convergence, the influence of particular predictors on the resulting stability properties, and the stiff error constants in the global error.}

	abstract = {{Peer two-step W-methods are designed for integration of stiff initial value problems with parallelism
		across the method.
		The essential feature is that in each time step $s$ 'peer' approximations are employed having similar properties.
		In fact, no primary solution variable is distinguished.
		Parallel implementation of these stages is easy since information from one previous time step is used only and
		the different linear systems may be solved simultaneously.
		This paper introduces a subclass having order $s-1$ where optimal damping for stiff problems is obtained by using
		different system parameters in different stages.
		Favourable properties of this subclass are uniform stability for realistic stepsize sequences and a
		superconvergence property which is proved using a polynomial collocation formulation.
		Numerical tests on a shared memory computer of a matrix-free implementation with Krylov methods are included.}},

		It has been shown that insufficient 'parareal' iterations lead to an inaccurate solution, while too

		We show that bounding the difference between the solution of the fine integrator and the 'parareal'

		guaranties a solution that is accurate enough in a minimum number of iterations.

		two-dimensional hyperbolic acoustic-advection system, which is often used as a test case for integration schemes
		for numerical weather prediction (NWP), is addressed.
		Parallel-in-time schemes are a possible way to increase, on the algorithmic level, the amount of parallelism, a
		requirement arising from the rapidly growing number of CPUs in high performance computer systems.
		A recently introduced modification of the "parallel implicit time-integration algorithm" could successfully
		solve hyperbolic problems arising in structural dynamics.
		It has later been cast into the framework of Parareal.
		The present paper adapts this modified Parareal and employs it for the solution of a hyperbolic flow problem,
		where the initial value problem solved in parallel arises from the spatial discretization of a partial
		differential equation by a finite difference method.
		It is demonstrated that the modified Parareal is stable and can produce reasonably accurate solutions while
		allowing for a noticeable reduction of the time-to-solution.
		The implementation relies on integration schemes already widely used in NWP (RK-3, partially split forward
		Euler, forward-backward).
		It is demonstrated that using an explicit partially split scheme for the coarse integrator allows to avoid the
		use of an implicit scheme while still achieving speedup.}},

Recently developed techniques for approximating oscillatory scalar functions by rational functions, and accelerated algorithms for computing functions of discretized differential operators are exploited.

In particular, one technique may be more efficient or physically more appropriate or less memory consuming than the other depending on the target of the simulation and/or on the sub-region of the computational domain.

	abstract = {{This work investigates the potential of an in-time parallelization of atmospheric chemical kinetics. Its numerical calculation is one time-consuming step within the numerical prediction of the air quality. The widely used parallelization strategies only allow a limited potential level of parallelism. A higher level of parallelism within the codes will be necessary to enable benefits from future exa-scale computing architectures. In air quality prediction codes, chemical kinetics is typically considered to react in isolated boxes over short splitting intervals. This allows their trivial parallelization in space, which however is limited by the number of grid entities. This work pursues a parallelization beyond this trivial potential and investigates a parallelization across time using the so called ``parareal algorithm''. The latter is an iterative prediction-correction scheme, whose efficiency strongly depends on the choice of the predictor. For that purpose, different options are being investigate and compared: Time-stepping schemes with fixed step size, adaptive time-stepping schemes and repro-models, functional representations, that map a given state to a later state in time. Only the choice of repromodels leads to a speed-up through parallelism, compared to the sequential reference for the scenarios considered here.}},

	abstract = {{This work proposes a data-driven method for enabling the efficient, stable time-parallel numerical solution of
systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The method assumes that low-dimensional bases that accurately capture
the time evolution of the dynamical-system state are available; these bases can be computed from snapshot data by proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) in the case of parameterized ODEs, for example. The method adopts the parareal framework
for time parallelism, which is defined by an initialization method, a coarse propagator that advances solutions on a coarse
time grid, and a fine propagator that operates on an underlying fine time grid. Rather than employing usual approaches for
initialization and coarse propagation (e.g., a typical time integrator applied with a large time step), we propose novel datadriven
techniques that leverage the available time-evolution bases. The coarse propagator is defined by a forecast (proposed in
Ref. [11]) applied locally within each coarse time interval, which comprises the following steps: (1) apply the fine propagator
for a small number of time steps, (2) approximate the state over the entire coarse time interval using gappy POD with the local
time-evolution bases, and (3) select the approximation at the end of the time interval as the propagated state. We also propose
both local-forecast initialization (i.e., the local-forecast coarse propagator applied sequentially) and global-forecast initialization
(i.e., the local-forecast coarse propagator applied over the entire time interval with global time-evolution bases). The method
is particularly well suited for POD-based reduced-order models (ROMs). In this case, spatial parallelism quickly saturates, as
the ROM dynamical system is low dimensional; thus, time parallelism is needed to enable lower wall times. Further, the timeevolution
bases can be extracted from readily available data, i.e., the right singular vectors arising during POD computation.
In addition to performing analyses related to the method’s accuracy, speedup, and stability, we also numerically demonstrate
the method’s performance. Here, numerical experiments on ROMs for a nonlinear convection–reaction problem demonstrate
the method’s ability to realize near-ideal speedups; global-forecast initialization with a local-forecast coarse propagator leads
to the best performance}},

@article{EghbalEtAl2016,
        abstract = {{The parareal algorithm is used to obtain temporal parallelization added to the parallelism obtained from the conventional spatial domain decomposition techniques for hydrodynamic problems. Parareal solution becomes unstable at high Reynolds numbers where the non-linear convection term in the Navier-Stokes equations becomes much larger than the diffusion term. A new framework that allows using parareal for unsteady high Reynolds number hydrodynamic problems is proposed where parareal coarse and fine time integration operators are incorporated with coarse and fine spatial grids respectively and \{RANS\} or \{DES\} turbulence models are employed with a blended filter that can be tuned for the stability of the method. This framework is composed of three solution stages where parareal serves as a transitional stage that bridges a coarse grid solution to a fine grid one. While in lower Reynolds number problems parareal solution can serve as a final solution, in higher Reynolds number problems with high degree of non-linearity parareal provides a shorter path to the final solution. Anticipating a parareal stage in a transitional sense allows a looser convergence requirement which leads to high speedup gains in that stage. On the other hand improved initial values at the beginning of the last stage yields a shorter final fine stage solution. A windowing technique is employed in this methodology to further control the parareal instabilities by keeping the parareal corrections smaller while still being able to cover an arbitrary simulation time with given computational resources. Application of this methodology has been illustrated with a fully turbulent vortex shedding from a cylinder and a flow from the Grand Passage tidal zone in the Bay of Fundy. It is concluded that a tuned turbulence model may sufficiently stabilize the parareal methodology for many practical problems such that it becomes applicable in the initialization process if not accurate enough as a final solution. \{MPI\} and OpenMP programming paradigms are used for temporal parallelism introduced by parareal and data parallelism obtained via spatial domain decomposition methods respectively. Also all computational tasks are accelerated using \{CUDA\} compatible GPGPUs.}},

One approach to overcome this barrier is to use methods that are parallel in time. These methods have the potential to achieve dramatically better performance compared to time-stepping approaches, but achieving this performance requires carefully choosing the amount of parallelism devoted to space versus the amount devoted to time. Here, we present
a performance model that, for a multigrid-in-time solver, makes the decision on when to switch to parallel-in-time and on how much parallelism to devote to space vs. time.

The idea is to explicitly construct an approximation to the time-evolution operator $\exp (\tau \mathcal {L})$ for a relatively large time-step $\tau $. Recently developed techniques for approximating oscillatory scalar functions by rational functions, and accelerated algorithms for computing functions of discretized differential operators are exploited. Principal advantages of the proposed method include: stability even for large time-steps, the possibility to parallelize in time over many characteristic wavelengths and large speed-ups over existing methods in situations where simulation over long times are required. Numerical examples involving the 2D rotating shallow water equations and the 2D wave equation in an inhomogenous medium are presented, and the method is compared to the 4th order Runge–Kutta (RK4) method and to the use of Chebyshev polynomials. The new method achieved high accuracy over long-time intervals, and with speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than both RK4 and the use of Chebyshev polynomials.},

In this work we develop a scheduling scheme for the parareal algorithm that is resilient to node-loss. The fault-tolerant scheme is based on a popu- lar approach introduced by E. Aubanel in [1], modified with a set of MPI interface extensions for implementing recov- ery strategies available in the ULFM framework. In ad- dition, we demonstrate how the parareal algorithm may be made resilient towards Silent-Data-Corruption (SDC) errors by viewing it as a point-iterative method, locally monitor- ing the residual between consecutive iterations so to discard potentially corrupt iterations.}}

The approach is able to bootstrap lower-order time integrators to provide high-order approximations in approximately the same wall-clock time, hence providing a multiplicative increase in the number of compute cores utilized. Here we provide a library that automatically produces a parallel-in-time solution of a system of initial value problems given user-supplied code for the right-hand side of the system and a sequential code for a first-order timestep. The user-supplied timestep routine may be explicit or implicit and may make use of any auxiliary libraries that take care of the solution of any nonlinear algebraic systems that may arise or the numerical linear algebra required.}},

This paper presents, discusses and analyses a massively parallel-in-time solver for linear oscillatory PDEs, which
is a key numerical component for evolving weather, ocean, climate and seismic models. The time parallelization in
this solver allows us to significantly exceed the computing resources used by parallelization-in-space methods and
results in a correspondingly significantly reduced wall-clock time. One of the major difficulties of achieving Exascale
performance for weather prediction is that the strong scaling limit ? the parallel performance for a fixed problem size
with an increasing number of processors ? saturates. A main avenue to circumvent this problem is to introduce new
numerical techniques that take advantage of time parallelism. In this paper we use a time-parallel approximation that
retains the frequency information of oscillatory problems. This approximation is based on (a) reformulating the original
problem into a large set of independent terms and (b) solving each of these terms independent of each other which
can now be accomplished on a large number of HPC resources. Our results are conducted on up to 3586 cores for
problem sizes with a parallelization-in-space scalability limited already on a single node. We gain significant reductions
in the time-to-solution of 118.3 for spectral methods and 1503.0 for finite-difference methods with the parallelization-in-
time approach. A developed and validated performance model gives the scalability limitations a-priory for this new
approach and allows us to extrapolate the performance method towards large-scale system. This work has the potential
to contribute as a basic building block of parallelization-in-time approaches, with possible major implications in applied
areas modelling oscillatory dominated problems.}},

In order to finish the calculation within a practical amount of time, it is an effective approach that applying Parareal method as one of parallel computing technique to transient stability analysis. In the Parareal method, the accuracy of the result is gradually updated through iterative procedures in combination with rough estimation of entire waveform and detailed calculation for each decomposed time window. Based on the Parareal method, the authors have developed a new stability assessment method by using chaos theory. If an operating point is in unstable region, the trajectory has the chaotic property, “sensitive dependence on initial conditions”. Therefore, it is possible to assess the stability by detecting the convergence characteristics of the estimated waveform at each iterative procedure by the Parareal method.

	abstract = {{Abstract Parareal is an iterative algorithm and is characterized by two propagators G and F , which are respectively associated with large step size Δ T and small step size Δ t , where Δ T = J Δ t and J ≥ 2 is an integer. For symmetric positive definite (SPD) system u ′ ( t ) + A u ( t ) = g ( t ) arising from semi-discretizing time-dependent PDEs, if we fix the G -propagator to the Backward-Euler method and choose for F some L -stable time-integrator it can be proven that the convergence factors of the corresponding parareal algorithms satisfy ρ ≈ 1 3 , ∀ J ≥ 2 and ∀ σ ( A ) ⊂ [ 0 , + ∞ ) , where σ ( A ) is the spectrum of the matrix A . However, this result does not hold when time-integrators that lack L -stability, such as the Trapezoidal rule and the 4th-order Gauss \{RK\} method, are chosen as the F -propagator. The parareal algorithms using these two methods for the F -propagator are denoted by Parareal-TR and Parareal-Gauss4. In this paper, we propose a strategy to let these two parareal algorithms possess such a uniform convergence property. The idea is to choose an L -stable propagator F ˜ and on each coarse time-interval [ T n , T n + 1 ] we perform first two steps of F ˜ , then followed by J − 2 steps of F . Precisely, for the Trapezoidal rule we select the 2nd-order \{SDIRK\} method as the F ˜ -propagator, and for the 4th-order Gauss \{RK\} method we select the 4th-order Lobatto III-C method as the F ˜ -propagator. Numerical results are given to support our theoretical conclusions.}},
