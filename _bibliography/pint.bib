It does not require solving any linear systems and is highly parallelizable. The two other methods proposed are based on Padé and Chebyshev approximations to the matrix exponential. The parallelization of these methods is achieved by using partial fraction decomposition techniques to solve the resulting systems and thus offers the potential for increased time parallelism in time dependent problems. We also present experimental results from the Alliant FX/8 and the Cray Y-MP/832 vector multiprocessors.}},

    abstract = {For the numerical integration of a stiff ordinary differential equation, fully implicit Runge-Kutta methods offer nice properties, like a high classical order and high stage order as well as an excellent stability behaviour. However, such methods need the solution of a set of highly coupled equations for the stage values and this is a considerable computational task. This paper discusses an iteration scheme to tackle this problem. By means of a suitable choice of the iteration parameters, the implicit relations for the stage values, as they occur in each iteration, can be uncoupled so that they can be solved in parallel. The resulting scheme can be cast into the class of Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) methods and, similar to these methods, requires only one LU factorization per step (per processor). The stability as well as the computational efficiency of the process strongly depends on the particular choice of the iteration parameters and on the number of iterations performed. We discuss several choices to obtain good stability and fast convergence. Based on these approaches, we wrote two codes possessing local error control and stepsize variation. We have implemented both codes on an ALLIANT FX/4 machine (four parallel vector processors and shared memory) and measured their speedup factors for a number of test problems. Furthermore, the performance of these codes is compared with the performance of the best stiff ODE codes for sequential computers, like SIMPLE, LSODE and RADAU5.}

    abstract = {In this paper, we analyze parallel, diagonally implicit iteration of Runge-Kutta methods (PDIRK methods) for solving large systems of stiff equations on parallel computers. Like Newton-iterated backward differentiation formulas (BDFs), these PDIRK methods are such that in each step the (sequential) costs consist of solving a number of linear systems with the same matrix of coefficients and with the same dimension as the system of differential equations. Although for PDIRK methods the number of linear systems is usually higher than for Newton iteration of BDFs, the more computationally intensive work of computing the matrix of coefficients and its LU-decomposition are identical. The advantage of PDIRK methods over Newton-iterated BDFs is their unconditional stability (A-stability for Gauss-based methods and L-stability for Radau-based methods) for any order of accuracy. Special characteristics of the PDIRK methods will be studied, such as the rate of convergence, the influence of particular predictors on the resulting stability properties, and the stiff error constants in the global error.}

@ARTICLE{Wang1998, 
	abstract={{The paper presents a new parallel method for the transient stability analysis of power systems. For simplicity, the classical power system model is adopted. The implicit trapezoidal rule is used to discretise the set of differential equations which describes the transient stability problem. As is well known, these discretised nonlinear algebraic equations are almost invariably solved by a Newton procedure. A parallel-in-time relaxed Newton method is proposed to solve the overall set of discretised equations concurrently on all the time steps. The proposed method has been tested on Cray-T3D by the use of PVM system. The test results show that the proposed method presents a good compromise between parallelism-in-time and convergence. Some important aspects for parallel transient stability analysis have been clarified}},

	abstract = {{The purpose of this Note is to propose a time discretization of a partial differential evolution equation that allows for parallel implementations. The method, based on an Euler scheme, combines coarse resolutions and independent fine resolutions in time in the same spirit as standard spacial approximations. The resulting parallel implementation is done in the non standard time direction. Its main goal concerns real time problems, hence the proposed terminology of “parareal” algorithm.}},

		across the method.
		The essential feature is that in each time step $s$ 'peer' approximations are employed having similar properties.
		In fact, no primary solution variable is distinguished.
		Parallel implementation of these stages is easy since information from one previous time step is used only and
		the different linear systems may be solved simultaneously.
		This paper introduces a subclass having order $s-1$ where optimal damping for stiff problems is obtained by using
		different system parameters in different stages.
		Favourable properties of this subclass are uniform stability for realistic stepsize sequences and a
		superconvergence property which is proved using a polynomial collocation formulation.
		Numerical tests on a shared memory computer of a matrix-free implementation with Krylov methods are included.}},

	abstract = {{Time stepping algorithm with spatial parallelisation is commonly used to solve time dependent partial differential equations. Computation in each time step is carried out using all processors available before sequentially advancing to the next time step. In cases where few spatial components are involved and there are relatively many processors available for use, this will result in fine granularity and decreased scalability. Naturally one alternative is to parallelise the temporal domain. Several time parallelisation algorithms have been suggested for the past two decades. One of them is the pipelined iterations across time steps. In this pipelined time stepping method, communication however is extensive between time steps during the pipelining process. This causes a decrease in performance on distributed memory environment which often has high message latency. We present a modified pipelined time stepping algorithm based on delayed pipelining and reduced communication strategies to improve overall execution time on a distributed memory environment using MPI. Our goal is to reduce the inter-time step communications while providing adequate information for the next time step to converge. Numerical result confirms that the improved algorithm is faster than the original pipelined algorithm and sequential time stepping algorithm with spatial parallelisation alone. The improved algorithm is most beneficial for fine granularity time dependent problems with limited spatial parallelisation.}},

Our approach uses firstly an explicit ODE solver to perform the parallel computations with different time-steps and then, a decomposition of the solution into specific convergent series, based on an extrapolation method, allows to refine the precision of the solution. Our proposed method exploits basic explicit integration methods, such as for example the explicit Euler scheme, in order to preserve the simplicity of the global parallel algorithm.

		differential equation by a finite difference method.
		It is demonstrated that the modified Parareal is stable and can produce reasonably accurate solutions while
		allowing for a noticeable reduction of the time-to-solution.
		The implementation relies on integration schemes already widely used in NWP (RK-3, partially split forward

		While the parareal algorithm was designed to enable real-time simulations, it holds particular promise for long

		This contribution extends previous work on the scheduling of tasks of the parareal algorithm to resources with

However, for a fixed-size simulation of this type, the efficiency of larger processor counts will saturate when the number of grid points per core becomes too small. To overcome this fundamental strong scaling limit in space-parallel approaches, we present a novel time-parallel version of the lattice Boltzmann method using the parareal algorithm. This method is based on a predictor–corrector scheme combined with mesh refinement to enable the simulation of larger number of time steps. We present results of up to a 32× increase in speed for a model system consisting of a cylinder with conditions for laminar flow. The parallel gain obtainable is predicted with strong accuracy, providing a quantitative understanding of the potential impact of this method.}},

		But when parallelization in space saturates, the time direction offers itself as a further direction for

		Three different strategies to reduce the computational cost of correction sweeps on the coarser levels are

	abstract = {{This work investigates the potential of an in-time parallelization of atmospheric chemical kinetics. Its numerical calculation is one time-consuming step within the numerical prediction of the air quality. The widely used parallelization strategies only allow a limited potential level of parallelism. A higher level of parallelism within the codes will be necessary to enable benefits from future exa-scale computing architectures. In air quality prediction codes, chemical kinetics is typically considered to react in isolated boxes over short splitting intervals. This allows their trivial parallelization in space, which however is limited by the number of grid entities. This work pursues a parallelization beyond this trivial potential and investigates a parallelization across time using the so called ``parareal algorithm''. The latter is an iterative prediction-correction scheme, whose efficiency strongly depends on the choice of the predictor. For that purpose, different options are being investigate and compared: Time-stepping schemes with fixed step size, adaptive time-stepping schemes and repro-models, functional representations, that map a given state to a later state in time. Only the choice of repromodels leads to a speed-up through parallelism, compared to the sequential reference for the scenarios considered here.}},

	abstract = {{This work proposes a data-driven method for enabling the efficient, stable time-parallel numerical solution of
systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The method assumes that low-dimensional bases that accurately capture
the time evolution of the dynamical-system state are available; these bases can be computed from snapshot data by proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) in the case of parameterized ODEs, for example. The method adopts the parareal framework
for time parallelism, which is defined by an initialization method, a coarse propagator that advances solutions on a coarse
time grid, and a fine propagator that operates on an underlying fine time grid. Rather than employing usual approaches for
initialization and coarse propagation (e.g., a typical time integrator applied with a large time step), we propose novel datadriven
techniques that leverage the available time-evolution bases. The coarse propagator is defined by a forecast (proposed in
Ref. [11]) applied locally within each coarse time interval, which comprises the following steps: (1) apply the fine propagator
for a small number of time steps, (2) approximate the state over the entire coarse time interval using gappy POD with the local
time-evolution bases, and (3) select the approximation at the end of the time interval as the propagated state. We also propose
both local-forecast initialization (i.e., the local-forecast coarse propagator applied sequentially) and global-forecast initialization
(i.e., the local-forecast coarse propagator applied over the entire time interval with global time-evolution bases). The method
is particularly well suited for POD-based reduced-order models (ROMs). In this case, spatial parallelism quickly saturates, as
the ROM dynamical system is low dimensional; thus, time parallelism is needed to enable lower wall times. Further, the timeevolution
bases can be extracted from readily available data, i.e., the right singular vectors arising during POD computation.
In addition to performing analyses related to the method’s accuracy, speedup, and stability, we also numerically demonstrate
the method’s performance. Here, numerical experiments on ROMs for a nonlinear convection–reaction problem demonstrate
the method’s ability to realize near-ideal speedups; global-forecast initialization with a local-forecast coarse propagator leads
to the best performance}},

        abstract = {{The parareal algorithm is used to obtain temporal parallelization added to the parallelism obtained from the conventional spatial domain decomposition techniques for hydrodynamic problems. Parareal solution becomes unstable at high Reynolds numbers where the non-linear convection term in the Navier-Stokes equations becomes much larger than the diffusion term. A new framework that allows using parareal for unsteady high Reynolds number hydrodynamic problems is proposed where parareal coarse and fine time integration operators are incorporated with coarse and fine spatial grids respectively and \{RANS\} or \{DES\} turbulence models are employed with a blended filter that can be tuned for the stability of the method. This framework is composed of three solution stages where parareal serves as a transitional stage that bridges a coarse grid solution to a fine grid one. While in lower Reynolds number problems parareal solution can serve as a final solution, in higher Reynolds number problems with high degree of non-linearity parareal provides a shorter path to the final solution. Anticipating a parareal stage in a transitional sense allows a looser convergence requirement which leads to high speedup gains in that stage. On the other hand improved initial values at the beginning of the last stage yields a shorter final fine stage solution. A windowing technique is employed in this methodology to further control the parareal instabilities by keeping the parareal corrections smaller while still being able to cover an arbitrary simulation time with given computational resources. Application of this methodology has been illustrated with a fully turbulent vortex shedding from a cylinder and a flow from the Grand Passage tidal zone in the Bay of Fundy. It is concluded that a tuned turbulence model may sufficiently stabilize the parareal methodology for many practical problems such that it becomes applicable in the initialization process if not accurate enough as a final solution. \{MPI\} and OpenMP programming paradigms are used for temporal parallelism introduced by parareal and data parallelism obtained via spatial domain decomposition methods respectively. Also all computational tasks are accelerated using \{CUDA\} compatible GPGPUs.}},

These methods have the potential to achieve dramatically better performance compared to time-stepping approaches, but achieving this performance requires carefully choosing the amount of parallelism devoted to space versus the amount devoted to time.

a performance model that, for a multigrid-in-time solver, makes the decision on when to switch to parallel-in-time and on how much parallelism to devote to space vs. time.

The idea is to explicitly construct an approximation to the time-evolution operator $\exp (\tau \mathcal {L})$ for a relatively large time-step $\tau $. Recently developed techniques for approximating oscillatory scalar functions by rational functions, and accelerated algorithms for computing functions of discretized differential operators are exploited. Principal advantages of the proposed method include: stability even for large time-steps, the possibility to parallelize in time over many characteristic wavelengths and large speed-ups over existing methods in situations where simulation over long times are required. Numerical examples involving the 2D rotating shallow water equations and the 2D wave equation in an inhomogenous medium are presented, and the method is compared to the 4th order Runge–Kutta (RK4) method and to the use of Chebyshev polynomials.

	abstract = {{Parallel-in-time integration is an often advocated approach for extracting parallelism in the solution of PDEs beyond what is possible using spacial domain decomposition tech- niques. Due to the comparatively low parallel efficiency of parallel-in-time integration techniques, they are primar- ily of interest as an extension for classical approaches at parallelism. As such, potential applications are expected to scale across several hundreds, or possibly thousands of nodes, making algorithmic resilience towards hardware in- duced errors highly relevant. In this work we develop a scheduling scheme for the parareal algorithm that is resilient to node-loss. The fault-tolerant scheme is based on a popu- lar approach introduced by E. Aubanel in [1], modified with a set of MPI interface extensions for implementing recov- ery strategies available in the ULFM framework. In ad- dition, we demonstrate how the parareal algorithm may be made resilient towards Silent-Data-Corruption (SDC) errors by viewing it as a point-iterative method, locally monitor- ing the residual between consecutive iterations so to discard potentially corrupt iterations.}}

In the Parareal method, the accuracy of the result is gradually updated through iterative procedures in combination with rough estimation of entire waveform and detailed calculation for each decomposed time window. Based on the Parareal method, the authors have developed a new stability assessment method by using chaos theory. If an operating point is in unstable region, the trajectory has the chaotic property, “sensitive dependence on initial conditions”. Therefore, it is possible to assess the stability by detecting the convergence characteristics of the estimated waveform at each iterative procedure by the Parareal method.

For symmetric positive definite (SPD) system u ′ ( t ) + A u ( t ) = g ( t ) arising from semi-discretizing time-dependent PDEs, if we fix the G -propagator to the Backward-Euler method and choose for F some L -stable time-integrator it can be proven that the convergence factors of the corresponding parareal algorithms satisfy ρ ≈ 1 3 , ∀ J ≥ 2 and ∀ σ ( A ) ⊂ [ 0 , + ∞ ) , where σ ( A ) is the spectrum of the matrix A . However, this result does not hold when time-integrators that lack L -stability, such as the Trapezoidal rule and the 4th-order Gauss \{RK\} method, are chosen as the F -propagator. The parareal algorithms using these two methods for the F -propagator are denoted by Parareal-TR and Parareal-Gauss4. In this paper, we propose a strategy to let these two parareal algorithms possess such a uniform convergence property. The idea is to choose an L -stable propagator F ˜ and on each coarse time-interval [ T n , T n + 1 ] we perform first two steps of F ˜ , then followed by J − 2 steps of F . Precisely, for the Trapezoidal rule we select the 2nd-order \{SDIRK\} method as the F ˜ -propagator, and for the 4th-order Gauss \{RK\} method we select the 4th-order Lobatto III-C method as the F ˜ -propagator. Numerical results are given to support our theoretical conclusions.}},

They are motivated as an extension to space-time of balancing domain decomposition by constraints preconditioners. The key ingredients to be defined are the subassembled space and operator, the coarse degrees of freedom (DOFs) in which we want to enforce continuity among subdomains at the preconditioner level, and the transfer operator from the subassembled to the original finite element space. With regard to the subassembled operator, a perturbation of the time derivative is needed to end up with a well-posed preconditioner. The set of coarse DOFs includes the time average (at the space-time subdomain) of classical space constraints plus new constraints between consecutive subdomains in time. Numerical experiments show that the proposed schemes are weakly scalable in time, i.e., we can efficiently exploit increasing computational resources to solve more time steps in the same total elapsed time. Further, the scheme is also weakly space-time scalable, since it leads to asymptotically constant iterations when solving larger problems both in space and time. Excellent wall clock time weak scalability is achieved for space-time parallel solvers on some thousands of cores.}},

The algorithm can be used to model grounded source IP surveys that show EM induction effects as well as airborne time-domain electromagnetic surveys that exhibit IP effects. IP effects are most often approximated as static or modelled in the frequency domain, using frequency dependent electrical conductivity. It is difficult to translate the frequency dependent conductivity approach directly to the time domain in a computationally efficient manner. We take an alternative approach in which we model IP relaxations in time using the stretched exponential function. We incorporate this IP model into a direct time-stepping discretization of the quasi-static time-domain Maxwell equations. We show that modelling of IP effects with this stretched exponential approach is asymptotically equivalent to the commonly used Cole-Cole model of IP transformed to the time-domain. We have implemented our algorithm using efficient numerical methods that allow it to tackle large scale problems and are amenable to use in inversion. In particular we have developed a parallel time-stepping technique that allows us to compute transient electric fields at multiple time-steps simultaneously. We demonstrate the behaviour of the stretched exponential model of IP decay as well as the efficiency of our algorithm by applying it to synthetic numerical examples that simulate a grounded source IP survey with significant EM effects and a concentric-loop airborne EM sounding over a chargeable body.}},

MGRIT is a scalable and multilevel approach to parallel-in-time simulations that nonintrusively uses existing time-stepping schemes, and in a specific two-level setting it is equivalent to the widely known parareal algorithm. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we present a two-level MGRIT convergence analysis for linear problems where the spatial discretization matrix can be diagonalized, and then apply this analysis to our two basic model problems, the heat equation and the advection equation. One important assumption is that the coarse and fine time-grid propagators can be diagaonalized by the same set of eigenvectors, which is often the case when the same spatial discretization operator is used on the coarse and fine time grids. In many cases, the MGRIT algorithm is guaranteed to converge, and we demonstrate numerically that the theoretically predicted convergence rates are sharp in practice for our model problems. Second, we explore how the convergence of MGRIT compares to the stability of the chosen time-stepping scheme. In particular, we demonstrate that a stable time-stepping scheme does not necessarily imply convergence of MGRIT, although MGRIT with FCF-relaxation always converges for the diffusion dominated problems considered here.}},

	abstract = {{The need for parallelism in the time dimension is being driven by changes in computer architectures, where performance increases are now provided through greater concurrency, not faster clock speeds. This creates a bottleneck for sequential time marching schemes because they lack parallelism in the time dimension. Multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) is an iterative procedure that allows for temporal parallelism by utilizing multigrid reduction techniques and a multilevel hierarchy of coarse time grids. MGRIT has been shown to be effective for linear problems, with speedups of up to 50 times. The goal of this work is the efficient solution of nonlinear problems with MGRIT, where efficiency is defined as achieving similar performance when compared to an equivalent linear problem. The benchmark nonlinear problem is the $p$-Laplacian, where p=4 corresponds to a well-known nonlinear diffusion equation and $p=2$ corresponds to the standard linear diffusion operator, our benchmark linear problem. The key difficulty encountered is that the nonlinear time-step solver becomes progressively more expensive on coarser time levels as the time-step size increases. To overcome such difficulties, multigrid research has historically targeted an accumulated body of experience regarding how to choose an appropriate solver for a specific problem type. To that end, this paper develops a library of MGRIT optimizations and modifications, most important an alternate initial guess for the nonlinear time-step solver and delayed spatial coarsening, that will allow many nonlinear parabolic problems to be solved with parallel scaling behavior comparable to the corresponding linear problem.}},

In contrast, traditional time-integration techniques impose serious limitations on parallel performance due to the sequential nature of the time-stepping approach, allowing spatial concurrency only. This paper considers the three basic options of multigrid algorithms on space--time grids that allow parallelism in space and time: coarsening in space and time, semicoarsening in the spatial dimensions, and semicoarsening in the temporal dimension. We develop parallel software and performance models to study the three methods at scales of up to 16K cores and introduce an extension of one of them for handling multistep time integration.

Non-uniform grids are essential to capture the singularities of “typical” solutions of time-fractional problems. We propose an efficient parallel-in-time multigrid method based on the waveform relaxation technique, which accounts for the nonlocal character of the fractional differential operator. To maintain an optimal complexity, which can be obtained for the case of uniform grids, we approximate the coefficient matrix corresponding to the temporal discretization by its hierarchical matrix (H-matrix) representation. In particular, the proposed method has a computational cost of O(kNM log(M)), where M is the number of time steps, N is the number of spatial grid points, and k is a parameter which controls the accuracy of the H-matrix approximation. The efficiency and the good convergence of the algorithm, which can be theoretically justified by a semi-algebraic mode analysis, are demonstrated through numerical experiments in both one- and two-dimensional spaces.}},

This method makes use of the iterative preconditioned \{GMRES\} algorithm for solving the linear systems, which has seen success for fluid flow problems and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. By transforming the resulting linear system of equations, one can obtain a method which is much less computationally expensive than the untransformed formulation, and which compares competitively with other time-integration schemes, such as diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta (DIRK) methods. We develop and test several ILU-based preconditioners effective for these large systems. We additionally employ a parallel-in-time strategy to compute the Runge–Kutta stages simultaneously. Numerical experiments are performed on the Navier–Stokes equations using Euler vortex and 2D and 3D \{NACA\} airfoil test cases in serial and in parallel settings. The fully implicit Radau \{IIA\} Runge–Kutta methods compare favorably with equal-order \{DIRK\} methods in terms of accuracy, number of \{GMRES\} iterations, number of matrix–vector multiplications, and wall-clock time, for a wide range of time steps.}},

In this study, we compare two time-parallelization approaches, parallel replica dynamics (ParRep) and parallel trajectory splicing (ParSplice), that were specifically designed to address this issue for rare event systems by leveraging parallel computing resources. Using simulations of the relaxation of small disordered platinum nanoparticles, a comparative performance analysis of the two methods is presented.

The basic concept is to solve for large blocks of space-time unknowns instead of marching sequentially in time. The methodology is a combination of a computationally efficient implementation of a parallel-in-space-time finite element solver coupled with a posteriori space-time error estimates and a parallel mesh generator. While we focus on spatial adaptivity in this work, the methodology enables simultaneous adaptivity in both space and time domains. We explore this basic concept in the context of a variety of time steppers including $\Theta$-schemes and backward difference formulas. We specifically illustrate this framework with applications involving time dependent linear, quasi-linear, and semilinear diffusion equations. We focus on investigating how the coupled space-time refinement indicators for this class of problems affect spatial adaptivity. Finally, we show good scaling behavior up to 150,000 processors on the NCSA Blue Waters machine. This conceptually simple methodology enables scaling on next generation multicore machines by simultaneously solving for a large number of timesteps, and reducing computational overhead by locally refining spatial blocks that can track localized features. This methodology also opens up the possibility of efficiently incorporating adjoint equations for error estimators and inverse design problems, since blocks of space-time are simultaneously solved and stored in memory.}},

We first review the three main interpretations of the parareal algorithm as a two-level method, a direct one, one based on geometric multigrid and one based on algebraic multigrid. The algebraic multigrid interpretation leads to the MGRIT algorithm, when using instead of only an F-smoother, a so called   FCF -smoother. We show that this can be interpreted at the level of the parareal algorithm as generous overlap in time. This allows us to generalize the method to even larger overlap, corresponding in MGRIT to   F(CF)ν -smoothing,   ν >=1 , and we prove two new convergence results for such algorithms in the fully non-linear setting: convergence in a finite number of steps, becoming smaller when   ν  increases, and a general superlinear convergence estimate for this generalized version of MGRIT.

With recent computer architecture changes leading to stagnant clock speeds, but ever increasing numbers of cores, future speedups will be available through increased concurrency. Thus, sequential algorithms, such as time stepping, will suffer a bottleneck. This paper explores multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) for an important application area, linear elasticity. Previously, efforts at parallel‐in‐time for elasticity have experienced difficulties, for example, the beating phenomenon. As a result, practical parallel‐in‐time algorithms for this application area currently do not exist. This paper proposes some solutions made possible by MGRIT (e.g., slow temporal coarsening and FCF‐relaxation) and, more importantly, a different formulation of the problem that is more amenable to parallel‐in‐time methods. Using a recently developed convergence theory for MGRIT and Parareal, we show that the changed formulation of the problem avoids the instability issues and allows the reduction of the error using two temporal grids. We then extend our approach to the multilevel case, where we demonstrate how slow temporal coarsening improves convergence.

The framework provides a priori upper bounds on the convergence of MGRIT V- and F-cycles with different relaxation schemes by deriving the respective residual and error propagation operators. The residual and error operators are functions of the time stepping operator, analyzed directly and bounded in norm, both numerically and analytically. We present various upper bounds of different computational cost and varying sharpness. These upper bounds are complemented by proposing analytic formulae for the approximate convergence factor of V-cycle algorithms that take the number of fine grid time points, the temporal coarsening factors, and the eigenvalues of the time stepping operator as parameters.  The paper concludes with supporting numerical investigations of parabolic and hyperbolic model problems. We assess the sharpness of the bounds and the quality of the approximate convergence factors. Observations from these numerical investigations demonstrate the value of the proposed multilevel convergence framework for the design of a convergent MGRIT algorithm. We further highlight that observations in the literature are captured by the theory, including that two-level Parareal and multilevel MGRIT with F-relaxation do not yield scalable algorithms, that iteration counts increase with increasing numbers of levels, and the benefit of a stronger relaxation scheme. The theory also proves in a two-level setting, and confirms for multilevel, that L-stable Runge-Kutta schemes are more amendable to parallel-in-time integration with MGRIT than A-stable Runge-Kutta schemes.}},

  abstract = {{Gander and Petcu (ESAIM Proc 25:114–129, 2008) reported that, theoretically, the convergence of the parareal method iteration for hyperbolic PDEs is strongly influenced by the phase (frequency) accuracy of the coarse solver calculation. However, no numerical study has clearly shown this. Therefore, through numerical tests, we investigate the influence of the phase accuracy of the coarse solver calculation on the convergence of the parareal method iteration for hyperbolic PDEs. First, we consider a simple harmonic motion and a multi-DOF mass-spring system (MDMSS) as examples of hyperbolic PDEs using the modified Newmark-  β method (Mizuta et al. in J JSCE 268:15–21, 1977), which can provide the exact phase of the time integration of a simple harmonic motion. Based on the results of the numerical tests, we show that the convergence of the parareal method iteration for hyperbolic PDEs is approximately independent of the parameters of parallel-in-time integration (PinT) and instead is dependent primarily on the phase accuracy of the coarse solver calculation. In addition, we show that reducing the number of bases in the reduced basis method (RBM) (Chen et al., in: Rozza (ed) Reduced order methods for modeling and computational reduction, MS and a modeling, simulation and applications, vol 9, Springer, Berlin, pp 187–214, 2014) causes the saturation of a decrease in an error during the parareal iteration for the MDMSS using the mode analysis method. The RBM is expected to make available accurate phase calculation in the coarse solver by maintaining the time step width as same as that of the fine solver. Second, we investigate whether the same saturation appears for the linear advection–diffusion equation when we use the RBM. We use the time evolution basis method in the RBM for the linear advection–diffusion equation. As a result, we show that reducing the number of bases causes the saturation of the decrease in the error in the linear advection–diffusion equation. Based on the results of the present study, an increase in the phase accuracy of the coarse solver calculation is strongly required for better convergence of the parareal method iteration for hyperbolic PDEs. Moreover, the saturation of the decrease in the error during the parareal method iteration should be overcome when using the RBM.}},

	abstract = {{In the strong scaling limit, the performance of conventional spatial domain decomposition techniques for the parallel solution of PDEs saturates. When sub-domains become small, halo-communication and other overhead come to dominate. A potential path beyond this scaling limit is to introduce domain-decomposition in time, with one such popular approach being the Parareal algorithm which has received a lot of attention due to its generality and potential scalability. Low efficiency, particularly on convection dominated problems, has however limited the adoption of the method. In this paper we demonstrate trough large-scale numerical experiments that it is possible not only to obtain time-parallel speedup on the non-linear shallow water wave equation, but also that we may obtain parallel acceleration beyond what is possible using conventional spatial domain-decomposition techniques alone. Two factors were essential in achieving this. First, for Parareal to converge on the hyperbolic problem we used an approximate Riemann solver as the preconditioner. This preconditioner introduces only dissipative errors with respect to the 3rd order accurate WENO-RK discretization used to solve the PDE system. The preconditoner is comparatively expensive and convergence is slow unless time-subdomains are short. We therefore introduce a new scheduler that we denote Communication Aware Adaptive Parareal (CAAP). CAAP increases obtainable speed-up by minimizing the time-subdomain length without making communication of time-subdomains too costly whilst also adaptively overlapping consecutive cycles of Parareal so to mitigate the impact of a relatively expensive coarse operator.}},

The time parallelization in this solver allows us to significantly exceed the computing resources used by parallelization-in-space methods and results in a correspondingly significantly reduced wall-clock time. One of the major difficulties of achieving Exascale performance for weather prediction is that the strong scaling limit – the parallel performance for a fixed problem size with an increasing number of processors – saturates. A main avenue to circumvent this problem is to introduce new numerical techniques that take advantage of time parallelism. In this paper, we use a time-parallel approximation that retains the frequency information of oscillatory problems. This approximation is based on (a) reformulating the original problem into a large set of independent terms and (b) solving each of these terms independently of each other which can now be accomplished on a large number of high-performance computing resources. Our results are conducted on up to 3586 cores for problem sizes with the parallelization-in-space scalability limited already on a single node. We gain significant reductions in the time-to-solution of 118.3× for spectral methods and 1503.0× for finite-difference methods with the parallelization-in-time approach. A developed and calibrated performance model gives the scalability limitations a priori for this new approach and allows us to extrapolate the performance of the method towards large-scale systems. This work has the potential to contribute as a basic building block of parallelization-in-time approaches, with possible major implications in applied areas modelling oscillatory dominated problems.}},

  abstract = {{With the stagnation of processor core performance, further reductions in the time to solution for geophysical fluid problems are becoming increasingly difficult with standard time integrators. Parallel‐in‐time exposes and exploits additional parallelism in the time dimension, which is inherently sequential in traditional methods. The rational approximation of exponential integrators (REXI) method allows taking arbitrarily long time steps based on a sum over a number of decoupled complex PDEs that can be solved independently massively parallel. Hence, REXI is assumed to be well suited for modern massively parallel super computers, which are currently trending. To date, the study and development of the REXI approach have been limited to linearized problems on the periodic two‐dimensional plane. This work extends the REXI time stepping method to the linear shallow‐water equations on the rotating sphere, thus moving the method one step closer to solving fully nonlinear fluid problems of geophysical interest on the sphere. The rotating sphere poses particular challenges for finding an efficient solver due to the zonal dependence of the Coriolis term. Here, we present an efficient REXI solver based on spherical harmonics, showing the results of a geostrophic balance test, a comparison with alternative time stepping methods, an analysis of dispersion relations indicating superior properties of REXI, and finally, a performance comparison on the Cheyenne supercomputer. Our results indicate that REXI not only can take larger time steps but also can be used to gain higher accuracy and significantly reduced time to solution compared with currently existing time stepping methods.}},

It is well known that such a CGC procedure is often the bottleneck of speedup of the parareal algorithm. For an ODE system with initial-value condition $u(0)=u_0$ the idea can be explained as follows. First, we apply the $\mathcal{G}$-propagator to the same ODE system but with a special condition $u(0)=\alpha u(T)$, where $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ is a crux parameter. Second, in each iteration of the parareal algorithm the CGC procedure will be carried out by the so-called diagonalization technique established recently. The parameter $\alpha$ controls both the roundoff error arising from such a diagonalization technique and the convergence rate of the resulting parareal algorithm. We show that there exists some threshold $\alpha^*$ such that the parareal algorithm with diagonalization-based CGC possesses the same convergence rate as that of the parareal algorithm with classical CGC if $|\alpha|\leq \alpha^*$. With $|\alpha|=\alpha^*$, we show that the condition number associated with the diagonalization technique is a moderate quantity of order $\mathcal{O}(1)$ (and therefore the roundoff error is small) and is independent of the length of the time interval.

	abstract = {{We apply a multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT) algorithm to hyperbolic partial differential equations in one spatial dimension. This study is motivated by the observation that sequential time-stepping is a computational bottleneck when attempting to implement highly concurrent algorithms, thus parallel-in-time methods are desirable. MGRIT adds parallelism by using a hierarchy of successively coarser temporal levels to accelerate the solution on the finest level. In the case of explicit time-stepping, spatial coarsening is a suitable approach to ensure that stability conditions are satisfied on all levels, and it may be useful for implicit time-stepping by producing cheaper multigrid cycles. Unfortunately, uniform spatial coarsening results in extremely slow convergence when the wave speed is near zero, even if only locally. We present an adaptive spatial coarsening strategy that addresses this issue for the variable coefficient linear advection equation and the inviscid Burgers equation using first-order explicit or implicit time-stepping methods. Serial numerical results show this method offers significant improvements over uniform coarsening and is convergent for the inviscid Burgers equation with and without shocks. Parallel scaling tests on up to 128K cores indicate that run-time improvements over serial time-stepping strategies are possible when spatial parallelism alone saturates, and that scalability is robust for oscillatory solutions which change on the scale of the grid spacing.}},

Our aim is to develop a better understanding of the convergence behaviour of these algorithms for this problem, which is known to be poor relative to the diffusion equation, its model parabolic counterpart. Using Fourier analysis, we derive new convergence estimates for these algorithms which, in conjunction with existing convergence theory, provide insight into the origins of this poor performance. We then use this theory to explore improved coarse-grid time-stepping operators. For several high-order discretizations of the advection equation, we demonstrate that there exist non-standard coarse-grid time stepping operators that yield significant improvements over the standard choice of rediscretization.}},

@article{KwokOng2019,
	abstract = {{Schwarz waveform relaxation (SWR) methods have been developed to solve a wide range of diffusion-dominated and reaction-dominated equations. The appeal of these methods stems primarily from their ability to use nonconforming space-time discretizations; SWR methods are consequently well-adapted for coupling models with highly varying spatial and time scales. The efficacy of SWR methods is questionable, however, since in each iteration, one propagates an error across the entire time interval. In this manuscript, we introduce an adaptive pipeline approach wherein one subdivides the computational domain into space-time blocks, and adaptively selects the waveform iterates which should be updated given a fixed number of computational workers. Our method is complementary to existing space and time parallel methods, and can be used to obtain additional speedup when the saturation point is reached for other types of parallelism. We analyze these waveform relaxation with adaptive pipelining (WRAP) methods to show convergence and the theoretical speedup that can be expected. Numerical experiments on solutions to the linear heat equation, the advection-diffusion equation, and a reaction-diffusion equation illustrate features and efficacy of WRAP methods for various transmission conditions.}},

In the proposed method, the parabolic equations are solved in parallel on both of the space and time directions. Under some reasonable assumptions, the optimal convergence theory is developed for the proposed space–time method, i.e., the convergence rate is independent of the mesh parameters, the number of subdomains and the window size. Some numerical results are given to confirm the theory very well in terms of the convergence rate and accuracy. And the strong/weak scalability obtained with 4096 processors is also reported to show the efficiency of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {{We present original time-parallel algorithms for the solution of the implicit Euler discretization of general linear parabolic evolution equations with time-dependent self-adjoint spatial operators. Motivated by the inf-sup theory of parabolic problems, we show that the standard nonsymmetric time-global system can be equivalently reformulated as an original symmetric saddle-point system that remains inf-sup stable with respect to the same natural parabolic norms. We then propose and analyse an efficient and readily implementable parallel-in-time preconditioner to be used with an inexact Uzawa method. The proposed preconditioner is non-intrusive and easy to implement in practice, and also features the key theoretical advantages of robust spectral bounds, leading to convergence rates that are independent of the number of time-steps, final time, or spatial mesh sizes, and also a theoretical parallel complexity that grows only logarithmically with respect to the number of time-steps. Numerical experiments with large-scale parallel computations show the effectiveness of the method, along with its good weak and strong scaling properties.}},

	abstract = {{High-performance computing trends towards many-core systems are expected to continue over the next decade. As a result, parallel-in-time methods, mathematical formulations which exploit additional degrees of parallelism in the time dimension, have gained increasing interest in recent years. In this work we study a massively parallel rational approximation of exponential integrators (REXI). This method replaces a time integration of stiff linear oscillatory and diffusive systems by the sum of the solutions of many decoupled systems, which can be solved in parallel. Previous numerical studies showed that this reformulation allows taking arbitrarily long time steps for the linear oscillatory parts. The present work studies the non-linear shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere, a simplified system of equations used to study properties of space and time discretization methods in the context of atmospheric simulations. After introducing time integrators, we first compare the time step sizes to the errors in the simulation, discussing pros and cons of different formulations of REXI. Here, REXI already shows superior properties compared to explicit and implicit time stepping methods. Additionally, we present wallclock-time-to-error results revealing the sweet spots of REXI obtaining either an over 6 ×  higher accuracy within the same time frame or an about 3 ×  reduced time-to-solution for a similar error threshold. Our results motivate further explorations of REXI for operational weather/climate systems.}},

abstract = "Metastability is one of the major encountered obstacles when performing long molecular dynamics simulations, and many methods were developed to address this challenge. The “Parallel Replica”(ParRep) dynamics is known for allowing to simulate very long trajectories of metastable Langevin dynamics in the materials science community, but it relies on assumptions that can hardly be transposed to the world of biochemical simulations. The later developed “Generalized ParRep” variant solves those issues, but it was not applied to significant systems of interest so far. In this article, we present the program gen.parRep, the first publicly available implementation of the Generalized Parallel Replica method (BSD 3-Clause license), targeting frequently encountered metastable biochemical systems, such as conformational equilibria or dissociation of protein–ligand complexes. It will be shown that the resulting C++ implementation exhibits a strong linear scalability, providing up to 70\% of the maximum possible speedup on several hundreds of CPUs."
