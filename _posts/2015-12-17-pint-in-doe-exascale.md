A report sponsored by the US Department of Energy on *Applied Mathematics Research for Exascale Computing* lists
parallel-in-time integration as one of six future directions of research in model discretisation.

Even though [the report](http://science.energy.gov/%7E/media/ascr/pdf/research/am/docs/EMWGreport.pdf) already appeared in 2014 and is strictly speaking no longer news, it
is still exciting to see PINT being mentioned prominently as one of the promising avenues for the path to exascale
computing.
