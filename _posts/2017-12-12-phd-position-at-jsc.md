JSC has an open position for a [PhD student](http://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Stellenangebote/_common/dipldok/d149-2017-jsc.html) in the field of parallel-in-time integration methods!

<!--more-->

For early 2018, Jülich Supercomputing Centre is recruiting a PhD
student in the field of mathematics and/or scientific computing with a
special focus on parallel-in-time integration methods.

The goal of this project is the development and analysis of
fault-tolerant iterative time-stepping methods to protect against node
failure and bit flips on large-scale supercomputers. The project is
embedded into the interdisciplinary research setting of the Joint
Laboratory for Extreme Scale Computing ([JLESC](https://jlesc.github.io/)).

Candidates should hold a university degree in the field of mathematics
or scientific computing and should have profound knowledge of iterative
methods and numerical ODE solvers as well as a strong expertise in C++
programming. Social competence and good communication skills for
collaborative work in and with interdisciplinary teams are essential.

The project runs for 3 years, salary is based on a research fellowship
for international students. For more information, please see [here](http://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Stellenangebote/_common/dipldok/d149-2017-jsc.html).
