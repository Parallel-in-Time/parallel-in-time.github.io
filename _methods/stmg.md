The _space-time multigrid_ method {% cite HortonVandewalle1995 %} treats the whole of the space-time problem simultaneously. The multigrid approach uses point smoothers and employs a parameter-dependent coarsening strategy that chooses either semicoarsening in space or in time on each level of the multigrid hierarchy.
