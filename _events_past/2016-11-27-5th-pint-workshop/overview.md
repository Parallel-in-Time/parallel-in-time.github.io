The efficient use of modern high performance computing (HPC) systems
has become one of the key challenges in computational science.  Top
HPC architectures have already attained million-way concurrency, and
current trends suggest that processor counts will continue to grow
rapidly.  Exploiting these levels of parallelism using traditional
techniques for spatial parallelism becomes problematic when, for
example, the problem size per processor shrinks and communication
costs begin to dominate.

This workshop brings together scientists from the fields of
parallel-in-time integration, multigrid methods, and domain
decomposition to discuss similarities between their respective
approaches to space/time algorithms, their applications and,
ultimately, their combination.  Questions arising in this context
range from possible coarsening strategies to suitable inter-level
transfer operators in space and time, and how other features of
time-parallel methods can be exploited to further enhance their
applicability to complex systems.

## Objectives

### Showcase

Recent  advances in  parallel-in-time  integration, in  terms of  both
theoretical  aspects  and practical  advances,  will  be showcased  by
participants through a series of contributed talks.

### Educate

Our intended participants include young researchers as well as domain
experts in time-parallel, multigrid, and domain decomposition methods.
The workshop will include several hands on sessions to develop
theoretical understanding of the techniques and approaches involved in
these fields and give participants a chance to further explore
opportunities for collaboration.

### Progress

Parallel-in-time integration methods have recently moved from
proof-of-concept to production applications through the development of
several software libraries that implement the MGRIT, Parareal, PFASST,
and RIDC algorithms.  The workshop will include hands on sessions to
walk potential library users through the process of incorporating and
using time-parallel methods in their codes.  Library designers will
also have an opportunity to exchange best-practises, design
principles, pitfalls etc.

## Proceedings

Participants with accepted abstracts will be invited to publish their
contributions, in the format of a short paper (maximum of 20 pages) in
the proceedings of the workshop, which will be published as a special
issue of **Computing and Visualization in Science** (Springer).
