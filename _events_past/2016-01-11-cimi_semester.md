In this workshop, we want to address the challenge of time-dependent
problems with time parallel methods. 

With the emergence of architectures with tens of millions of cores before the end of the decade, current
parallelization strategies usually based on parallelization in space
inevitably reach their intrinsic limits. The objective of the workshop is
to gather a limited number of people sharing an interest on the topic of
time-parallel methods and to foster discussions and collaborations.

Confirmed invited speakers are currently 

- Matthew Emmett (Computer Modelling Group Ltd, Calgary, Canada), 
- Martin Gander (University of Geneva, Switzerland),
- Robert Speck (Juelich Supercomputing Centre, Germany).

Interested participants are asked to propose a contribution to the
workshop in the form of an abstract **before December 10th 2015**. Abstracts
should be sent to vasseur@cerfacs.fr and notifications of acceptance
will be given no later than December 15th 2015. There are no
registration fees for the workshop and full details of how to register
will be available soon.

For further information please contact Xavier Vasseur
(vasseur@cerfacs.fr) and Serge Gratton (serge.gratton@enseeiht.fr).
