The goal of this summer school is to introduce basic and advanced
parallel-in-time methods to researchers interested in understanding
these methods, and to give them detailed insight on how these methods
reduce various error components and are used in practice.

The course will cover parallel-in-time methods for various
time-dependent problems ranging from parabolic and hyperbolic partial
differential equations (PDEs) to PDE-constrained optimization
problems.

The school is suitable for young mathematicians (PhD students and
highly motivated Master Students), who wish to either get in touch
with parallel-in-time methods, as well as young researchers and
Post-docs who desire to strengthen and broaden their knowledge on
advanced time-parallelization techniques.

The event is funded by the European Mathematical Society and the Indam
GNCS group.
